### Problem Statement

The 2 subreddits we will be looking at are [/r/TheSilphRoad](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/) and [/r/pokemongo](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/). What we want to determine is if The Silph Road is actually more tailored to experienced players of Pokemon Go compared to the pokemongo subreddit. We hope that by using NLP and testing different classification models we can differentiate posts between the two subreddits by finding language that is more akin to veteran players of the game. If we can accurately tell the difference between posts on the two subreddits, the hardcore players of The Silph Road will be able brag that their subreddit is the superior one.
