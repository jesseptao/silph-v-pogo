"Yeah, no one care, but I hope you got your shiny registeel ; or whatever registeel you were looking for.

While for me, I grinded hard for Regirock without finding it shiny, and even harder for Registeel and it just turned out being a big waste of money, time and energy. 25 raids and not a single Shiny Registeel.

I spent these 2 days on remote raid groups hoping to get that green registeel, but now i have just a box full of useless scraps. For one raid the game even kicked me out and i wasted a ticket for nothing.

I started playing pvp, but i got bored doing just that and so i started shiny hunting, but this has been so frustrating that I'm thinking to taking a break from the entire game for a while. Until the next good event, which looks like it will be in febbruary with (another) kanto event and its shiny mew.

In 2 years i never dropped this game but now it really got my nerves. This is not just about my unluck
Regis with their shiny chance lasted just 2 days, while the useless and none-shiny Kyurem is gonna be with us until the end of the year, and still viable during regis event. 
Niantic is becoming really greedy with these things, they are asking to you to buy tickets, and also 12$ for shiny mew is a P2W, they made some paid events before but never this exclusive for the one who pays. 

We are talking about a game that has not much of quality and it has new annoying bugs and glitches every new versions. I understand they have to earn something,  really; but this is too much if you ask me. Not even a week after the announce of the kanto event, and here it came galarian mime event, 8 $. They can't be serious, they are pushing too much, and since the pandemic in my country is making hard to play, i have to temporanely drop the game.

* Trainers can only trade with a Best Friend. All the Startdust costs of Trading will remain the same.

"GO League's servers lead certain regions to experience over 100-200 m/s of latency in PVP constantly with nearly no solution to combat it. Giving as they just promoted GO battling to their official youtube channel I felt like this was a good time to raise my concerns.

In perfect mirror matches with perfectly synced fast moves move, a user with high latency will always forfeit a fast move when they click on a charged move. There are a few videos out there that showcase this in detail.

I have played POGO league since its release with an average season finish of 2900 ELO and know the mechanics behind turns of moves well enough to be almost certain that the only rationale for such a common occurrence to be server lag. I've tried high-speed connections 100+mb/s download and sub-20 ping to Sydney servers for all popular online games, different phones (latest models and such), yet no matter how many factors (besides my physical location)  I try to control nothing changes. I'm aware of the ""queue fast move trick"" that seemed to help a lot of people and it just doesn't work for me as by the time my queue registers the opponents next fast move is already flying towards me.  

  
The worse thing about this is that it is seemingly one-sided if one person has worse latency than the other, losing several fast moves every battle, resulting in heavily weighted battles.  


Now with Pokemon GO's emphasis on ranking high and maintaining it seems absurd how they have not added at least a few extra servers to compensate for it being a global game.  Who knows maybe I've been doing something wrong the entire time and if so I'd like to hear your suggestions as to how to remedy this, but I haven't been able to talk about this with anyone as I don't talk to with other top ranked people within my Sydney region.

"The slowly leaking faucet of Pokemon for this region has been frustrating from day one.  I'm never in a rush to fill my Dex and I love to go out and hunt, but when most of the desired Pokemon have spawn rates close to Unown, it really dampens my enthusiasm for playing.

The fact that eggs and GBL are being used more and more to exclusively release new mons is also upsetting.  I'm a new player to Pokemon in general, so I cannot play in GBL because I don't have the decades memory about typing and counters etched into my brain, and I personally despise the fact that Eggs and Incubators are the Loot Boxes of Pokemon Go.  having more and more mons released in ways that makes them unavailable to certain Trainers is a flex of such greed on Niantic's part that is distinctly revolting.

Apparently a billion dollars a year isn't enough, and my only curiosity at this point is seeing how far Niantic will go before their bottom line starts to drop when even the whales will feel like they're being exploited.

Kalos is being rolled out now, and I still have less than half of my Unova Dex filled.

"Hi,

new player here. I'm trying to understand the battle system, but I'm kinda confused. So when I fight an arena I can attack by tapping the screen.   
1. Do I have to tap the screen as fast as I can or what is here the most effective way?

2. When the screen has this yellow outline I swipe left or right to evade right? Evading outside this yellow outline is useless?  
3. Do I activate the strong attack when the icon is fully filled right?

4. Is evading really effective so are the fights really skill based or is it just a nice bonus but stats is what matters most?  


So my biggest confusion occurred when I had a fight vs team rocket. For some reason I could not evade...  
5. So how does the fight work here and why is it different from arena fights?

And now for the ""Ways you can evolve it"": 

Noibat needs 400 candy to evolve into noivern so you have to catch 134 if you don't want to transfer any.
Which is near impossible if you ask me.


Just using rare candy can do the job but if you ask me who would be willing to spend 397 candy just to evolve a worthless bat.


And the third way is by catching and transfering them
So you can catch 101 and transfer 100 of them to evolve one fellow noi bat which is still tough to do since not many people even know about this pok√©mon.

"Before you read this let me make it clear that the concept of rewarding longtime players is always cool, but what Niantic is rewarding players for just isn‚Äôt fair.

If you didn‚Äôt know already, Legacy 40 is a badge that will be given to all players who reach level 40 by the end of the year. Now, reaching level 40 in Pok√©mon GO is no small task. On average, it takes around 1 and a half years of playing to reach that rank and that‚Äôs if you have the time to play a few hours a day. 

I began playing Pok√©mon GO last May when I finally received a smartphone that could, barely, handle the game (Samsung Galaxy S4). Keep in mind that my family doesn‚Äôt pay for a huge phone plan so I have a limited amount of mobile data to use. I played almost everyday during the summer and a little less during the fall but ended up reaching level 30 by New Years.

For Christmas, my friend received the IPhone XR and gave me his old IPhone 6 which I thought could run the game better. Unfortunately, I was dead wrong. Playing Pok√©mon GO on the IPhone 6 is the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had with a game, excluding Pok√©mon Masters. I can‚Äôt take snapshots of my Pok√©mon, I can‚Äôt send gifts, battling just straight up doesn‚Äôt work, and worst of all the game crashes every 5-10 minutes. After another year of playing, I am only level 33.

Now you may be asking, ‚ÄúHow does that stop you from getting XP.‚Äù Everyone knows the most effective way of getting XP is adding friends and sending them gifts, but since my phone can‚Äôt do any of that I can‚Äôt level up. Catching Pok√©mon is also an effective way of receiving XP. But as stated before, the app crashes all the time so I barely have any time to catch any. Not to mention that my Pok√©mon storage is full and I can‚Äôt upgrade it because I can‚Äôt battle in gyms and I don‚Äôt want to spend money on coins.

Like me, there are some players that don‚Äôt have the time or the right phone to play the game. It‚Äôs not fair that Niantic is rewarding players who can afford to either spend money on high-end phones, data plans, in-game coins, or have the time to actually play this game for long periods of time. I think Niantic should either give a similar badge to all who have been playing since before 2021 or not give out this badge altogether.",I don‚Äôt like the idea of Legacy 40,pokemongo

"I love the new tagging system, but I imagine the playerbase would love it more if the Storage had the option to hide tagged Pokemon. It would be the closest thing to Storage Boxes.

If you're into organising your Pokemon Storage, then you would already have a vast amount of permanent Pokemon, whether they've been powered up, shiny, or extras.

Having your entire collection of Pokemon assigned to a tag and hidden - would leave a small minority of non-tagged in which you could view and debate whether to tag or transfer.

"Don't get me wrong I am loving all of these home events. With all the recent community days, the free 3 hour incense event, the upcoming holiday event and then the Kanto event coming up. I am sure there is more events coming around past the Kanto one as well given that the Pandemic will likely poor over into late 2021.  


However, it's really taken a hit on the amount of Poke Balls, Great Balls and Ultra Balls. I went from having a solid amount well into the hundreds heading into the other community day we had with Magmar and Electabuzz. Ever since then I feel like I have to go into the game each day now and max out my gift opening limit.   


Listen, some of us if not most of the world is in lockdown again. So even if some players wanted to go out and spin their Pokestops they can't. Sure they can get balls every now and then from opening gifts, but some trainers aren't fortunate to get the amount of gifts to max out everyday. Not to mention even when you max out your gift opening daily limit its not like you get a lot of balls for that anyway. Even if players do manage to get a good amount of balls from gifts there have been a lot of nice at home events going on that make us use them so we can't store them up.  

  
Each week I try to store balls, but with so many nice at home events it's hard to. Plus with the new feature to get XL candy one of the biggest ways of earning XL candy is to catch Pokemon. I am not sure if I am the only one having an issue with getting enough balls to be able to play all of these at home events. Sadly, if this keeps up I might just have to face it and only shiny check when there are at home events that feature shiny Pokemon. Nothing is worse than community day or a 2x stardust event comes around and your low on balls. Yet you can't go out and get more either because the weather is just to cold, you can't drive, you don't want to drive around for Pokemon Go, you're sick or you're in lockdown.","I wish Niantic was a little more generous with Poke Balls, Great Balls and Ultra Balls",pokemongo

"I'm not sure if everyone is aware of this, but I just figured this out, and it's taken all the stress away from trying to coordinate Ultra/Best friends with people. This trick requires that you keep tabs on the people who are about to upgrade friendship levels on your friends list. If you know you're 1 day away from becoming Ultra/Best Friends with someone, and the other person has the final gift to trigger it: upon logging on, IMMEDIATELY click on your friends list and see if they've triggered it by clicking on their name and confirming that your friendship level with them has gone up (also, if they've opened a gift from you that day, there will be a blue circle around their avatar). If they've triggered a new friendship level, exit your friends list, immediately go to your item bag, and use a Lucky Egg. As long as you use the Lucky Egg prior to the 'You and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are now Ultra/Best Friends!' screen appearing, you WILL STILL get 2x exp from it. This basically means that even if you're not online when the person opens the gift to trigger the new friendship level, you can still get 2x exp from it as long as they don't immediately delete you from their friends list after triggering it (I know this has happened to me, and other members of this community. My heart goes out to you).

"I understand a business needs to make money, but this winter event is just really an unnecessary money grab now especially for newcomers. 

Every winter since the game started, Niantic has done a winter event where Ice pokemons show up in the wild. Now they're requiring an $8 fee for a lackluster Galarian Mr Mime and the use of incense for ice pokemon? To me, I have a bunch of incense lying around but pretty sure newer players do not. What annoys me about incense is that you have to wait for the next pokemon. It's just one pokemon at a time. Make multiple pokemon show up just like in the wild. 

I mean this is just one of the annoying things Niantic has been doing lately. Here are others thats been mentioned here: 

-two different raid passes when every pass should just be the same
-rewarding players for not purifying pokemon
-lack of spawns for event specific quests
-crappy egg pool. I mean there was a literal trash in the 12km egg. 
-lack of distance trading
-removal of Legendaries from the weekly reward and placing weird common pokemon

-lucky friends

If a teen would decide that he/she wants to get on the quest to max out their Registeel XL, it would be feasible that this teen would finish high school, go to uni, get a job, get married, have a child and send that child to preschool BEFORE they would be able to use their Registeel XL in Ultra League.

Now tell me that‚Äôs not straight up revolting.

Yes, Niantic will probably fix it by adjusting XL candy rates, like they always do, like they did with the broken Mega system (still kinda is) since no sane person was spending money on doing Mega Raids before the fix.

This is beyond the point. Niantic needs to stop releasing completely broken features just to fix them later when they see just ‚Äúhow much can a player be squeezed‚Äù.

&gt;  
&gt;No, this is not the case at all. Wayspots can only be  removed if we receive reports from players indicating that a given  location no longer exists (i.e. is invalid), or if we receive a request  from a property owner. Once we receive these reports, we evaluate the  data to ensure a POI removal is warranted, based on our criteria.

"My wife recently bought me a Go-Tcha Evolve. I am excited but also nervous. It feels like that I was used to the slow way of riding a bike in the park, but now all of a sudden I was given a Ferrari and asked to go to the freeway.

Some background about myself: I started playing in March this year, and currently level 37. I am a F2P player, and don't do PvP at all. I go out to do raids 5-6 times a week with my family, with the free passes only. I put pokemons in gyms trying to get 50 coins every day, and I have been able to get at least 250-300 coins a week. We live in a quiet suburb, with plenty of gyms and stops, thanks to a local college. I use coins only to buy storage for items and pokemons. I have about 350 coins right now. I am a lucky dex filler, and every night we would trade with each other at home.

Currently I have 1600 in Pokemon storage and 1700 in item bag. I am almost always close to full capacity for both, and usually very few regular Pokeballs. I am very bad at deleting things, both items and pokemons. So far, it doesn't seem to work well for the few days that I have had this device. It would often stop catching perhaps due to lack of regular Pokeballs, and whatever it caught seems crappy ones. Sometimes I tried to adjust the setting so that it would only spin stops without catching, but somehow it doesn't always do what I thought was asking it to do. I feel that there was a vicious cycle: it would use up regular balls quickly, and for whatever it gets out of later spinning, it would ""waste"" them quickly too.

What is the best practice? I am certainly not getting its best use, hence I am posting here seeking advice. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I have a few questions too, but any general tips would be appreciated.

Q1: How many regular Pokeballs should I maintain? (assuming that I would use it on a 20-minute car drive. There are 20+ stops and 5-6 gyms along the way.)

Q2: How many empty slots should I keep in the item bag daily? If I have to remove things to make room, what should go first?

Q3: How many empty slots should I keep in the pokemon storage?

Q4: If/when I have coins, should I buy storage for items or pokemons first? In the past, when it was much lower-key, I would try to keep them at a same pace.

Q5: I noticed a dishearteningly high proportion of Pokemons ran away on my journal. I read that it is because it only uses regular balls and only shoots straight. Based on the journal entries, it seems that as long as a pokemon has high CP, it would almost be guaranteed to flee. How do you guys deal with this issue (if that bothers you)?

Q6: If I manually spin or tap on a Pokemon, would that confuse the device?

If you can answer any questions, or provide any helpful tips, I would really appreciate that. If there are ""tutorials"" or important posts/articles on Reddit or elsewhere, I would appreciate being pointed to the right direction. Thank you all in advance.

P.S. I made an almost identical post on TSR too, as these are the two subs out of only three that I frequent and subscribe to on Reddit.

XL candy is rare and near impossible to get for most legendary pokemon. The most reliable ways to get XL candy for rare pokemon are walking or using rare candies to combine them into XL at a horrendously imbalanced ratio of 100:1.

Niantic surely knows that they made incredibly high requirements of leveling and powering up pokemon. At my current rate, it will take me another 6 - 8 years to get to level 50. (I play relatively frequently, going out for raid days on Wednesdays, spending some time every day and more on the weekends roaming for catches and raids.)

Currently, I'm a level 27 Trainer.

I've also read that I can power up a Pokemon up to 10 levels higher than my Trainer's (so, since I'm level 27, theoretically my Pokemon could be powered up to level 37)

Hey there i am a mostly solo pokemon go player .I was gonna buy the ticket and checked mystic7's video in which he said i have to trade with a friend who chose the other version . I don't have friends in my area who are gonna buy the ticket so i might be stuck here . Is mystic7 just guessing or do i really need a friend to trade with .

"The idea sounds stupid, but it could honestly work. 

Start the game by visiting Professor Willow and partake in his training class. Take a test and the results decide which team you're in for this course. (Mystic, Valor or Instinct) You then are shown how to battle,the first Pok√©mon you catch in Willow's Garden is your starter. Throughout the course, you are to travel across the region, completing tasks Prof. Willow has to offer for you. 

Level up your Pok√©mon by battling along the routes outside of cities, or take on city gyms. Gyms are different, there is no leader, it's just a place to train in case the route gets boring, and you can always rebattle the opponents. 

Learn about the dark secrets of Team Rocket and their plan make all Shadow Pok√©mon. Stop them by defeating each grunt and purifying the Shadow Pok√©mon. 

While traveling along routes, you may encounter powerful and rare Pok√©mon, make sure to team up with your teammates and capture the rarest ones. 

Once you complete your course, you can now battle in the league. Take on other opponents from other teams and make your way to the top. Battle each leader and become the champion of the region. 

Discover Team Rocket's secret plan and battle against Giovanni. Be careful while fighting against his Shadow Mewtwo. Try and capture it, it might be very tough.

"Level 42 task ""Collect 100,000 stardust"" is making catching mons a lot more fun.

When catching, you toss the ball, the mon is caught and you wait for one shake, two shake, three shake, caught.

Frustrating when they break out, especially just before shake 3.

But while doing these tasks, I discovered that the game determines your success the very micro-second the ball catches the mon, as I am awarded the stardust cost even before the first shake.  If I don't see the bar, I know it's going to break out at 1-2- or before shake 3.  

Even with quick catches, I know as I escape and skip the animation if I need to reclick that mon, or not.

Going to miss that nice little trick once I finish the task.

  After reading all these comments I came to the conclusion that you are all just human garbage.

I already knew that Reddit is a disgusting place, but was willing to give it a try, until I'm on Lvl. 40.

Behaving that aggressive about critique that has maybe not even anything to do with you personally is a sign of a mental disorder.

You went even that far and downvoted every comment I ever made, even in other communities, I mean that's just psychological.

Don't worry I deleted those comments but this post should remind everyone of you about your perverted behaviour.

And don't worry the moment I get to 40 I'll leave you all alone in your self-inflicted Reddit-Limbo.

Yet I do hope that you find some kind of happiness outside your Internet bubble, because there's no way your life can turn out well, if you react to a justified critique in such a disproportionate aggressive way.

"Hi guys,

Basically, I'm asking under what circumstances should you use a TM, to replace a Pok√©mon's moves?

And when should you use the ""New Attack"" button (costs Stardust &amp; Candy), to give a Pok√©mon an addition move?

Reason I ask is;

I have an Electivire, that currently has the Flamethrower (Fire type) charged move, and since it's an Electric type Pok√©mon, I'd rather it have an Electric charge move (for STAB &amp; consistency with its fast attack).

Since Flamethrower was only available for a limited time, as well as I think it would be beneficial to have 2 different types of special attack available, I was thinking to use the New Attack instead of a TM. 
But just thought I'd ask, how good is Flamethrower as a move anyway?

PS - How exactly does a New Attack work? 
I'm presuming it just adds a 2nd charged attack button on the battle screen, allowing you to pick which one to use?

"Some local players here are exploiting a bug by which is able to do multiple raids for the win 30 raids challenge with one raid pass. 

If sharing exploitive bugs is not allowed here please let me know. I will remove the post. 

The steps are according to a post shared 

Join a raid 

Try to defeat the boss as fast as possible. 

 When the raid is over doe not capture the pokemon.

Exit the gym and enter another raid (Remote pass can also be used)

When in the lobby exit and return to the gym with the first raid 

When we return to catch screen pokemon it will count as if we had won another raid.

Do this as much as possible 

As long as the initial raid lasts, you can repeat these steps and you will only have spent one pass.

Example :You won the raid and you have 200 seconds left, you will have 200 seconds to leave, enter another raid and return to the one you finished. 

That is you have as much time as the 300s timer ends to add more number of raids won.

"I started playing again this summer with a couple of friends to get outside. So far I enjoyed it a lot. Then I got into PvP. This season I played my most games ever because I have a decent GL Team. The problem starts right here. I have a stunfisk (g) and thought it would be a great addition to my team pool. I had like 20-30 Charge TMs in my inventory. Thought it a second move (first one was Earthquake, so pretty good), it's muddy water. Use a charge TM and get flash cannon. Try another one, muddy water again. This goes on until I had less than 10 Charge TMs left. Normally I wouldn't care but a few days later the rocket event happened and I didn't had enough TMs for the mons I saved for this day. Now the UL started and  I have pushed a machamp to around 2500 Cp. Same thing different mon: Thought it a second move (first was Cross Chop). Didn't get Rock Slide, so I used my last Charge TMs on it, didn't get the attack I wanted. This is a huge bummer for me cause I don't Raid a lot to get TMs. Now I'm left with 2 mons with the wrong attacks for PvP, don't have any Charge TM left and not really motivated to play PvP. This TM system is just a huge pile of garbage (without looking at the CDay moves which are huge for PvP). I think the system needs a change.

"Just finally reached lvl 40. Started playing back there in 2016 but stopped for a long period and now thanks to you guys and all those gifts from r/PokemonGoFriends I'm finally in this mark. I'll probably try to hit 41 by the end of the year now or at least be close to it.

Remember if you are still grinding:

1. Try to add as much people here as possible and send 100 gifts every day and open yours 30 (from different people), and if you have lucky eggs do this between midnight to get 60 gifts doubled XP plus those who opened yours.

2. Do raids, especially 5* and invite as much as you can. Increase your friendship with this too and get ~40k per raid without lucky egg.

3. Aim for Excellents! You really should try/practice, it gets very easy after a few days/hours depending on how much you play.

- I do not play for so many hours, so I was able to get ~500k/Day wo/LE since I started grinding two weeks ago. So if you live near a gym and are getting 50 coins per day and have some coins saved, you can buy some LE and get more than 1M/Day with these efforts plus incense/lures and new events coming next week and even more gifts will be available to open/send, so GOOD LUCK TO ALL YOU.

-Another advice, even if you don't want to be lvl 40, you can still grind to lvl 38 and you'll be able to put new gyms and pokestops in your neighborhood.

"Some local players here are exploiting a bug by which its possible to complete multiple raids for the win 30 raids challenge for level 41 with one raid pass. 

If sharing exploitive bugs is not allowed here please let me know. I will remove the post. 

The steps are 

Join a raid 

Try to defeat the boss as fast as possible. 

 When the raid is over doe not capture the pokemon.

Exit the gym and enter another raid (Remote pass can also be used)

When in the lobby exit and return to the gym with the first raid 

When we return to catch screen pokemon it will count as if we had won another raid.

Do this as much as possible 

As long as the initial raid lasts, you can repeat these steps and you will only have spent one pass.

Example :You won the raid and you have 200 seconds left, you will have 200 seconds to leave, enter another raid and return to the one you finished.

"Hi Reddit.
It been a long time since I last used Reddit, so please bear with me and my long post.
I‚Äôll try to come with as much information as possible or as I can remember.

So I‚Äôve been playing Pok√©mon Go since it first arrived in 2016.
I started playing on an Android device because at the time it wasn‚Äôt available in my country.
I have upgraded my phone throughout the years and am currently using a iPhone XR. I also have an iPad Air 2 that I had PoGo on.
Now here is my problem.
Every time I try to purchase from an iOS device the game is stuck thinking.
I found a work around that worked until iOS 14 (I think).
I had to:
-open the settings app.
-click on my name
-media and purchases
-sign out
-open PoGo
-click shop
-click item

Here‚Äôs where certain things happen.

If I have pok√© coins or it‚Äôs a free item, the sale is complete.
However, if I‚Äôm trying to use actual money (let‚Äôs say to purchase coins or an event ticket.)
From in PoGo app a promt comes up saying a need to login into the App Store.
I login, then another promt comes up telling me to login.
Now here where things get weirder.
In rare cases the purchase is made.
In other cases the game either ‚Äúthinks‚Äù forever and I have to completely exit and close; or it says the purchase was successful, however, I get a promt immediately after saying the item was already purchased and with be added in game for free. Now in the second scenario (not sure if I spelled that correctly, don‚Äôt @ me) the item isn‚Äôt added an and I have no way to purchase other than digging up an older Android device and purchasing on that.
That however isn‚Äôt the point.
I‚Äôve tried contacting Niantic Support in app and through Twitter, none of their suggestions work.
I eventually got in contact with AppleSupport Senior staff.
After over an hour or trying different things, they (apple support) believe that somehow a double login was somehow created on Niantics servers, due to me starting originally on an Android and then possibly logging in on iOS (then connecting my PoGo account afterwards).

Apple suggested I talk with Niantics senior support staff, however there‚Äôs no telephone for Niantic.
The only way I can get ahold of them is through Twitter and they always give the same advice that doesn‚Äôt work.

I figured Reddit is the next best place to try.

Please help. And thank you.",Pok√©mon Go iOS shop glitch,pokemongo

"Quick PSA! If your adventure sync isn‚Äôt working I found a fix!!!

If you are on an IPhone, follow these steps
1- disable adventure sync on Pok√©mon go
2- go to settings and turn location to while using app, and motion tracking to off.
3- go to the search bar of setting and type in health, once the health app icon appears select it, and click on the bottom option, Data Access and services, click on Pok√©mon go and disable it.
4- Go back into Pok√©mon go and enable adventure sync. Complete the steps the app tells you too and it should be fixed!
5- Have fun hatching eggs! (Trubbish &amp; Absol)

"I've had it with how stupid the game's suggestions are for each Rocket grunt battle, seriously The grunt will warn me that they'll use ground types, only for the game to suggest sending out Reshiram and Dragonite, last time a Rhyperior was added into the mix. I get that certain types resist others, still a shit suggestion, but why the hell would Reshiram be there? I've got a strong Kyogre with water attacks and great grass types with suitable attacks. I'm guessing the system also takes the opponents attacks into account.

But what bothers me the most is that the game clearly saves the last party you used for each grunt, but it's not the first suggestion that pops up, I have to leave the grunt and talk to them again. Sometimes I'm very unlucky and their time at the stop runs out, or I pass by the stop on the bus and can't spin the stop again. I'm guessing the grunt has a different party for every time you talk to them, but I've tried manually picking my Pok√©mon to see if it will give me ""Previous team"" next time and the results are never favorable.

Why not just show the last party used everytime? I'd add a picture to the post showing an example of what I meant, but I didn't understand how. If the game is smart enough to tell which types work and which don't, it's smart enough to acknowledge that previous parties will probably work.

At first I was exited, who wouldn‚Äôt be I can have 12 eggs now instead of the standard 9, but with it comes a huge drawback that nobody seems to be talking about.

My issue is that when you have 9 eggs, your three additional slots can only be taken up 12k eggs or AS eggs, once you‚Äôve hatched an egg from your original 9 storage spaces, one of the eggs from your additional 3 slots gets moved into the original 9.

This has led me to having 12, 12km eggs with only my standard incubator.

For me to clear all of the eggs that I have in my storage I would need to walk 144km.

For just 12 eggs.

For perspective if I walked that much hatching only 2km eggs that‚Äôs a total of 72 eggs.

I‚Äôm all for the additional slots but I shouldn‚Äôt be punished for not having super incubators, the three additional egg slots should stay as they are and not transfer into my original 9 slots.

I really hope players like myself are compensated by Niantic for this issue by giving us a few free super incubators, and not forced into buying the adventure box to simply clear out my eggs for a test that I‚Äôm doing for them.

If this is how they plan to move forward with the egg storage system it‚Äôs purely there for them to encourage players into buying incubators because they really don‚Äôt have much of a choice.

At the current standard the system is broken and I would honestly prefer it to revert back to the original 9 slots.

"I use the AR mode very rarely.
However, for catching the reward for the recent Jesse and James Special Research, the Shiny Celebi, I had to turn it on.
What I did, was that I clicked on a Cottonee, then turned on the AR switch in the upper ringt corner, then clicked on the AR warning text, then the ""run away"" icon to stop trying to catch the Cottonee. 

Then, after clicking the button for making the Celebi starting to appear, I tried throwing Pokeballs at it. 

The problem was that all the balls went above it. 

I tried to back up, to create some distance between us, but since it just disappears, then reappears in a new location every 10 seconds or so, that was not helpful. 

Then I tried to hold my phone in an angle that should have made the Pokeballs hit directly into the ground before me..
..but they did not. And after doing the opposite, holding it in and angle that should have made the Pokeballs being thrown far, far away, I could finally see what the issue was:

The gravity force for the Pokeballs was reversed.
So, when I threw a ball, it would go forward for a while, then just fly up, up and away,  disappearing into the sky.
Since I stood next to a tall (40 - 50 meters) building, I tried throwing towards it, and then I saw the Pokeballs hitting the building, then rolling upwards along the wall, before rolling over the roof and then disappearing. 

If this had been just a normal day, I would have just closed and restarted Pok√©mon GO, hoping the issue would fix itself. 
But I was not sure if I would get a new chance of catching that Shiny Celebi.

So, instead, I turned my phone upside-down. 
Even if it didn't work 100%, at least it made it possible to try to throw the Pokeballs directly onto the Shiny Celebi. And, since I had an unlimited number of throws, I could just keep on throwing. 

I guess one Pokeball of every 10 - 20 I throwed, actually did hit that Shiny Celebi. And the first 2 times it hit, it would not stay inside the Pokeball. But the 3. time  - then I got my Shiny Celebi.",Pokeball in AR falls UPWARDS..,pokemongo

"Don‚Äôt know if this has been mentioned before on here, but I have a couple of tips for opening gifts faster. Personally I find it a super repetitive task and if anyone out there is grinding for Exp like me you may find this helpful.

Tips:

1. After pressing the ‚ÄòOpen‚Äô button on a gift start immediately hitting the ‚Äòx‚Äô underneath. This skips the gift opening animation, the items inside from displaying and the friendship increase animation. Slightly faster than tapping through all of that stuff.

2. When in the friends list it is possible to select multiple friends to open at the same time by tapping them at the same time. This will cause them to open on top of each other. I‚Äôve managed a total of 5 on my phone (I don‚Äôt know if you can do more on bigger screens)

"Yesterday I was watching the news and there was a segment about a fisherman in greece  teaching people how to fish and gather trash from the ocean amd he is getting awarded by the UN ,and I was thinking players of pokemon go walk millions of kilometers per year . Maybe we could make a change as well . The idea is that Niantic can come in contact with recycling companies from different countries and in spots with high activity ( i believe they can track activity of pokestops) there can be placed recyclers .  

How can it work though ? In my head I thought of this way . You go to the pokemon go recyclers which is also a pokestop but in a different overview just to make sure everyone can see it . By scanning your qr code you will be given a multiple use bag maybe with pokemon images outside or you could even perhaps choose between the three teams you got . The bag is a one time thing unless perhaps you increase your recycling level which may mean that your bag was overused. The machine will also give a pair of gloves once a day cause at the end of the day we will be picking trash . 

At the end of your walk and after gathering the trash you can throw the trash in the recycler and by counting the amount of trash you gathered you can get a respective amount of pokecoins . That way players will ve awarded with pokecoins and Niantic will get a good name for helping recycling and protecting the environment.

"This is an idea I had when battling in the league and I though I would share it. Apologies if this has been posted before (if it has I didn‚Äôt see it)/ is poorly tagged.

At level 15, all of a players rewards turn into candy (1 candy per win for a regular pass and 2 for premium) for one entry/ five battles. This means from a purely number based perspective (not taking the Pok√©mon into account), a level 15 player has a 50% likelihood of getting candy every battle (they either win or lose), while a regular player has only a 6.25% likelihood overall (feel free to check my math, I could be wrong: I got this figure by putting 1/2 to the 4th power since you need 4/5 wins to get candy).

Candy is a really valuable item, so I have started checking the rank of the people I‚Äôm fighting (appears prominently on the loading screen before the battle), and if they are level fifteen I will forfeit the match (after fighting them; I figure best case I lose naturally and worst case I give them a unexpected win and bamboozle them). I do this every time I see a level 15 player unless I‚Äôm at 3/5 wins (at that point I have an the same likelihood of getting candy as they do).

I don‚Äôt mean to insinuate anyone is wrong or selfish if they don‚Äôt do this. Battling is competitive by nature and it would suck if you don‚Äôt get candy because you forfeited a previous match. This is just an idea if you can afford a loss and want to be extra nice.

When they announced the new levels and the rewards for being a Legacy Level 40 trainer, I was about halfway through Level 38 - about 6.5M XP short of Level 40. I decided to document my grind for Level 40: here's what it looked like, in a simple Excel sheet! I kept track of:

\- How much time I played per day

\- My XP (I used Level 38 the starting point of ""0 XP"", so the total I needed was 8M: 3M from Lvl 38-&gt;39, 5M from Lvl 39-&gt;40)

\- The change in XP per day

\- How much XP left I needed

\- And the average XP I would need to earn per day, if the last day was Dec. 31st.

My strategy was, as visible from the notes, making friends and getting XP from becoming great and ultra friends. I added about 150 friends over the first week (mostly through r/PokemonGoFriends, becoming good, then great friends, and using four lucky eggs: one when I had a bunch of great friends lined up, two during the 12/1 spotlight hour when there was double evolve XP, and one when I had about 15 ultra friends lined up.

Overall, this was definitely a grind - I played a lot more Pokemon GO than I've played in a long time, but it was really fun, both because there have been so many events recently, and because I enjoyed keeping track of my progress. And I'm definitely surprised it took only about a month to make up about 6.5M XP for me. I could have hit it earlier - as soon as last weekend, as I had some ultra friends lined up - but decided to just run through the rest of the days playing normally.

And yes, I had quite a bit of fun learning some new things about Excel worksheets (may have dropped in on r/excel a couple of times) to make this a bit more aesthetically pleasing for myself.

"I have a bunch of Friends on Pokemon GO that rapidly send out invites. However I can't accept them all because I'm out of remote passes or they invite me to a raid I'm not interested in. It can be disappointing to invite 5 people to a raid, and you don't know why no one showed up.

To solve this issue, I think a raid wish list should be added. On every profile there can be an option where you can select up to 5 of the current raid bosses you would like to be invited to. It could say something like ""Invite me to 1) Kyurem, 2) Mega Gengar, 3) Rufflet, 4) Flygon, 5) Pinsir"" or something similar. There could also be options such as ""Not interested in Raiding"" or ""No preference."" These would all be publicly displayed for friends to see at any time. Also, during the select screen for sending raid invites, the friends who want to raid that specific Pokemon will have their names highlighted or appear at the top of the list. That doesn't prevent you from inviting certain people to raids they don't want to participate in, it's just that the people who do want to participate will be prioritized for being invited.

Also, being able to show how many remote raid passes you currently have on your Profile could go a long way. No point of inviting certain people if they can't even raid in the first place.

I know that a simple in-game chat system would make this idea irrelevant, but I'm not comfortable with that in a GPS-based game that is played by children. Hopefully you guys like this idea, I think it would drastically approve remote raiding as the only thing close to this in the game is the online-indicator.

I live in a large college town 3 schools with a large entertainment district downtown. There are hundreds of gyms in my area. The next town over has a very large network of gyms as well. So today my girl and I both had the day off and a babysitter so we went out on a hunt. We putted around town and went a town over for 3 full hours. In that span we saw 178 gyms. Yes 178 we kept track today. During this span we went and came at different times at the same places to see if one would pop nothing. I also have 6 gyms within view from my apartment. Since the event I log in at least every half hour or so to check raids. Have not seen 1 rufflett since the event started.

I find myself filling up my inventory very easily (it can only hold 450 items because I only buy things with coins I get from taking over gyms.) To get more Pok√©balls, I find myself having to dispose of a lot of excess berries or potions. Rather than throwing these items away, it would make sense to give us the option to sell extra items, like you can do with handheld and console versions of the game. This would work especially well for getting a lot of people some extra coins, given the fact that it‚Äôs harder to get outside and go to gyms regularly for a lot of people due to quarantine.

"When I first started playing, the gyms in my area were always a fairly balanced amount of all three colour, and it was peaceful. 

Then, one day, yellow started to take the red gyms but leave the blue ones. I always tried to take them back, but at the time I was still a pretty low level player and their Pok√©mon were all double the strength of mine, so I struggled. Nevertheless, I persisted. I was usually knocked out again within minutes, but it was the thought that counted, right? 

Then blue decided to join the yellows too. The moment I turned a gym in my area red, someone would take it down and turn them either yellow or blue. 

I started grinding to get higher levels and stronger Pok√©mon. I think I jumped from level 13 to level 27 in the space of two weeks. I was determined to take back control of the situation. 

Finally I got to level 30, and had farmed candies and stardust so I could power up some Pok√©mon purely for putting them in gyms. I made note of my bf‚Äôs and his best friend‚Äôs account details so I could put their Pok√©mon in gyms too. 

One day, I left for college a whole hour and a half earlier than normal and walked all through my area, taking down EVERY gym I saw. There was already one red gym, with just one Pok√©mon in it. I golden razzed his Pok√©mon and put mine, my bf‚Äôs and his best friend‚Äôs in there too. I then sat on the bus and in college lessons with the app open but not doing anything, just so that if I saw the ‚Äú(insert Pok√©mon here) needs some attention....‚Äù banner I could quickly check the situation and Berry them. 

The other two teams were relentless. I regularly saw large groups of people loitering around the areas the gyms were located, constantly trying to take back control. But the reds in my area were obviously sick of it too. They started giving out golden berries and camping the gyms too. In the end, the other two teams gave up, and then we let them take back some gyms, but not all of them. The two just around the corner from my house are always red. If they turn yellow or blue, they stay for 8 hours and then get booted by a red player who lives literally opposite the gym. 

It was a very fun little war, but I‚Äôm glad that balance has been restored once again. There‚Äôs currently a situation similar to this one in my boyfriend‚Äôs area, so it looks like we‚Äôre planning another one soon!",The story of how I accidentally started a rebellion in my area,pokemongo

"When I first starting playing PoGo backing in 2016, I was on a college campus and had plenty of spawns and stops. After I graduated, I moved to a major city and had stops and spawns reachable from both my house and my job. These were glorious times and I was loving every minute of it. If I went and visited my family, I only had 2-3 days of a no-spawn zone, but I knew I would return to a better place to play.

However, I recently moved to a more rural location and have been struggling to feel engaged by PoGo. If I want to go out and enjoy a community day or just grind some star dust, its a 10 minute drive to anywhere useful (which compared to some people, it is not that bad). I have a handful of Pokemon that spawn in my neighborhood which is nice, but a void has been created (only to be magnified by COVID and its restrictions). The world of pokemon I knew is no longer right outside my door step.

Due to these lifestyle changes, I get why there are some people who spoof just so that they can play a game they love that would otherwise not be playable. I absolutely do not condone this and acknowledge that it is cheating. I have not spoofed since day 1 and will never spoof. I have encountered people hard locking gyms down (very frustrating and the pokecoin system is a whole other conversation) with spoofing or joining raids when there isn't a soul around me.

"So I started playing this game a week ago after a long pause since launch and I must say I enjoyed it a lot.

But now that everything is getting more of a routine, I find myself more and more often being totally annoyed to the point that I'm almost losing my mind HOW BAD THE APP IS PERFORMING.

Why is everything in this app so tediously slow?? How on earth is the game years old but the menu still feels like 5 fps? Why do touch interactions not register if you try to be fast and efficient? How on earth am I supposed to catch a pokemon that is placed 10 miles away? The faster I try to throw the ball, the laggier it gets and the ball just limps to the ground.

The gifting menu is just a bad joke. I joined a community to exchange gifts but the design of the gifting process is SO BAD... It takes like half an hour to open the gifts and send gifts. Someone must have thought this is the way it's done, but what is the purpose of this slow process?

This game needs a third automatic tapping finger that just constantly taps on the screen to dismiss every constantly popping up unnecessary dialogue.

I feel bad for my phone already because I tend to vent my frustration on it... BTW my phone is a Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, so my phone performance shouldn't be an issue. 

It really went fast from a cool retro feeling to ""I never want to start this app again because it's making me more aggressive than any first person shooter"". I'm pretty much done with Pokemon GO again, after only one week. I really like the game itself but I just can't cope with the terrible app. I can't believe that I'm the only one though.",This game is a mess.,pokemongo

"Quite a few people seem to report a rather big increase of spawn points around their house in rural ares. Usually 4-5 more, spme even reported going from something like 6 -&gt; 19-20 spawn points.

Meanwhile during the entirety of yesterday I didn't notice any changes, not even during the Spotlight hour walking around. Since roughly 1am gmt changes became noticable. I used to have 4 spawns right by my house and 2-3 just a bit further away if my gps drifted just a tad bit. Now it seems I actually lost a spawn after I had already lost a spawn point after the last change prior! Not only that, my spawn points are now all spread further away. And they seem to have a different time pattern now too. So whenever I'm playing, I only see maybe 2 spawns what used to be 4-5. Reading everybody else having a nest or a cluster of spawns now and I once again get shafted loosing a spawn point is just so disheartening and disapointing.

"I know many have made this complaint before, but maybe if we keep complaining something will change?

My Pokemon got stuck in a gym in a rural area for a ridiculously long time. My poor Gallade was there for over a month! (I know some of you have had it worse, but I'm still upset) Now the annoying thing is, he wasn't being fed berries but his CP wasn't going down either. He was always at the exact same amount.

So what do I do? I contact support because this has to be some sort of glitch. Right? No berries in over a week should mean CP decreases to 0. But nope. Always stuck at exactly 586 CP.

I'm not sure why I thought Niantic would say ""oh yes, that's a glitch, we'll kick your pokemon and you can have him back."" Instead I get told they have no way to kick a pokemon from a gym. Really? You were able to remove legendaries from peoples accounts when you accidentally released them at the start of the game 4 years ago, but with all the advancements you've made you can't kick a pokemon from a gym????? Ridiculous.

So I finally got my Gallade back and the story still isn't over. (I don't know who knocked him out but THANK YOU!) I've been avoiding putting pokemon in gyms because now I'm worried I'll never get them back. So I finally put one that I didn't particularly care about in two days ago. And he got kicked today. The same day my Gallade finally got kicked. So a month of being stuck in a gym from some glitch and I didn't even get coins.

TL;DR My Gallade was stuck in a gym for over a month and I didn't even get coins for it. And Niantic support was less than helpful.",NIANTIC SUCKS! Another Pokemon stuck in a gym...,pokemongo

"Sorry for the cryptic headline, but you need to take a walk with me. 

This started as a complaint. Niantic's arbitrary and capricious decision to omit 2018 Community Day moves during the December yearly wrap up still stands as the hands down absolute worst thing they have ever done. Myself - and possibly millions of others - had gotten into Battle League this year, spurred on by ease of use during quarantine. All year we've been wanting those exclusive moves, the best of which go back to 2018, as most players were not even around then. I myself played day one but fell off and only came back around the anniversary last year. I really got screwed in missing Swampert day by less than a week, what with it being the single most important day in Battle League history. Now I have to get screwed again? 

So there I was, gleefully catching a ton of everything during the Summer celebration. The one that featured each generation in a different week. It was a fantastic way to catch a bunch of each starter, really get a good one of each and save it until you could evolve it with its exclusive move. Or so we thought. Months and months I've been waiting for the December wrap up - and in 2020, it feels like 15 years have passed :( - only to be massively disappointed that many of those best moves were still unavailable. And for what reason, I ask you? Because Charizard has two exclusive moves and they don't want to figure out which one to give you? Best reason I can come up with. 

Oh, but it's all ok because we have Elite TMs, right? You know, the thing that makes this game more pay to win than it has ever been, allowing people to buy into those moves of the past for only $10 a pop? Yep, Elite TMs are really saving the game! :/ To be clear, even making them more plentiful would  hardly be helpful, as you probably want more than one of each exclusive move for different leagues. And come on, are you really going to waste a TM on Umbreon? When Dewgong is right there? I didn't think so. 

It's not enough. Never will be. No one wants to pay for more. I've been holding out on Charizard all year, assuming I could just get the move in December. That worked out well...  


BUT WAIT!! WHAT'S THIS? Did I just get an Elite Charged TM as a Battle League reward? Has that always been a thing? Was it a guarantee for reaching rank 19? This changes EVERYTHING.

My gf loves the special research so a gift I'm making for her for Christmas is some custom research quests; one for each week of next year which would ideally have three goals in it.

What I'm looking for here are any suggestions about what might make for good custom research quests that would be good for a week or so. Catching a specific Pokemon wouldn't be great because of the changes in spawns every few weeks.

Hey,

Why are some shadow pokemon ranked higher on pvpoke than their normal form and vice versa? So for example Swampert.

So I'm fairly new to gym battling (in relation to a lot of y'all, at least) and I've run into a situation that I'm not sure is normal or not. I'm hoping y'all can help me out.
So recently my S.O and I have been battling and putting pokemon in nearby gyms (per the norm) and we noticed there has been one player that, when we knock his pokemon out of a gym, will immediately drive out to where we are and knock out our pokemon out and fill up the gym again. (We actually think this player has 6 accounts as the gym will fill up with 6 pokemon from the same 6 accounts). When we try to battle it back, the player will continue to feed his pokemon berries until we leave. This player has even followed us in his car, knocking out any gyms we fill along the way. 
Is this normal? The following-us part honestly kinda freaked me out. 
Any feedback would be great! Thanks!",Gym etiquette question,pokemongo

Today i wanted to claim an Arena 20 Mins before a Raid started, while i was getting them out one by one (Arena was full at the beginning) the last one doesn't wanted to get kicked out and he feeded his pokemon. 
When he was nearly out (1 more kill to kick) because i did not battled alone anymore, there was suddenly a second pokemon in the arena!
I was like ""ok he may entered while i use potion for my pokemon"" and just battled again.
When i killed the 2 there was suddenly another one in! I stopped brawling and to my surprise the arena was completely full again! How the heck is the possible? 

Tl;dr 
Why did they change it that someone can enter an arena while other are fighting?  That not fun.",Arena fight,pokemongo
Gyarados is used on a lot of the ultra cup teams. So to counter this is started using my shadow electivire (13/13/15) which should be 4x effective but i can't seem to beat it. It has electric shock and wild charge which should be the best dps moves. Electric type pokemon look to be extremely weak in comparison to other pokemon in these higher cp cups. Do you guys have the same problem ?,Gyarados vs electivire in ultra cup,pokemongo

"Reason is? I cannot meet jessie and james. Egg? It hatched when I working some distance. Great throw? It ended. But there‚Äôs no meowth baloon. 

They said we could meet more meowth baloon, but it wasn't. I met three baloons from yesterday, but two baloon was team rocket grant. I don't think this is a lot. Balloons don't come out very often, and they're all just grant.

"With knowing what IVs a pokemon will more or less have depending on weather boost and the level they appear at, if you see that its going to be a low level legendary/mythical pokemon, is it possible to try again with the catches or is it finalized even before you start the battle/catch? 

For example, if after I complete the new shiny celebi special research I see on the catch screen its CP is 1363 (an IV score of 80) can I shut the game off and go back to the catch screen in hopes of getting celebi at 1399, which is a 100% IV score.

"I have a bunch of friends (from r/PokemonGoFriends) all over, and I prioritize 12km eggs. Because of this, I end up with a fair amount of Pokemon from random parts of the world. I like to trade them to local friends, in part for the badges. 

Today I was playing with search terms and tagging, and wound up with 3 distance groupings that split my ""distant"" Pokemon into roughly even groups: 50-5,000km, 5,000-10,000km, and 10,000+km

(By 'roughly even' I mean they're [within an order of magnitude at least](https://i.imgur.com/XjkDWEN.jpg).)

I thought it was interesting to see, and made me wonder about friend &amp; egg distance distribution for other players.

I'm in the US, so the smallest range for me includes all the US &amp; Canada eggs, the second contains mostly European, and the last group is mostly my friends in Korea and Singapore. 

Have you found any interesting distance-based patterns or quirks in your collection?

P.S. In case you don't know, you can search for these using the ""distance"" keyword followed by a km range. For example my search terms are `distance50-5000`, `distance5000-10000`, and `distance10000-`.

"For those who are struggling to find Meowth balloons for this event I'd like to point out how team rocket balloons spawn and how to use this to greater your chance for getting Meowth balloons, but before you read below this only applies if Meowth balloons and team go rocket balloons have the same mechanics which I'm not completely sure of yet. If anyone knows if this is not the case please comment below as there isn't a lot of information on the mechanics of the Meowth balloons online and my information below is only based on experience so far.

So to start off, team rocket balloons have 4 times slots where they can spawn 12am-6am, 6am-12pm, 12pm-6pm, and 6pm-12am. Also in my experience the balloons spawn more frequently when you first open the app, so if you haven't seen a balloon and your in a new time slot, try restarting your app, waiting a few min, and keep repeating until it  spawns. This means (if they have the same mechanics) you have 4 chances of getting a Meowth balloon a day and if that balloon is just a regular team rocket balloon, you need to wait until the next time slot in order to roll the dice again. Also, in order to get the achievement you only need 2 balloons as each balloon has 2 battles in it. Now I'm not sure the exact percentage Meowth balloons spawns rather than a regular balloon but I'm sure if your checking each time slot each day of the event you will be set on getting the shiny Celebi!

"Everybody who's even played a Pokemon video game knows about those two things : 

* If you walk past a trainer and they spot you, you have to battle against them
* There are items laying around the world that can be picked up once

Some players prefer to only battle specific trainers to open up the world hastily where other players prefer to battle with all of them and gain as much XP as possible before advancing the story. Game creators face this challenge where they have to balance the game in a way that both those options will yield a fun yet challenging experience for the player.

**Pokemon battles**

Niantic introduced 3:3 Pokemon battles a while ago, against mono-typed GO Rocket Grunts. As you most likely know, they take control of Pokestops, and present a battle CTA when you interact with the interest point. They appear pseudo-randomly for a short period of time, and cannot be fought twice unless you lose the fight. There are currently a handful of reasons to fight against them :

* Getting Shadow Pokemon, which have powered up moves, but are more expensive to power-up
* Getting to fight against a Rocker Leader, granting XP, healing items, and 12km eggs
* On special occasions, fighting against Giovanni and rescuing a legendary Pokemon

As much as those previous points can be exciting, they get repetitive and get easy very quickly. Most regular players will never lose a Rocket fight, or on rare occasions will have to update their team and win on the second attempt. 

**The pandemic, and the interest points**

A lot has changed. Distance required to interact with objectives has been dramatically decreased, making it easier for players to enjoy the game while making sure they stay far enough from other players. One problem remains : some players live so far from interest points that playing the game is nearly impossible without gifts, and you need interest points to acquire some to send back in return. 

Some players lack healing items, catching devices, berries, etc. The only real ways to acquire items are to visit Pokestops, open gifts, or buy some from the shop. 

There's a weird balance between spawn locations and stops. A cluster of stops does not necessarily means lots of spawns, and vice versa. Some players get a tremendous amount of wild Pokemon, but no items. This gets problematic quickly, especially because Pokeballs are surprisingly expensive in the in-game shop compared to raid passes and upgrades, and you cannot buy Great and Ultra balls.

Players tend to stop sending gifts when the receivers don't gift back. Relying on gifts isn't viable unless you personally know at least 20 players living close to interest points that are willing to only send.

**Adding trainers and items**

Something interesting I was chatting with friends about was the idea of having features from the Pokemon games adapted to Pokemon GO.

To keep the game balanced, this would need to come with certain compromises. 

**Over-world items**

Every morning at 6AM local time, items would be scattered everywhere within a timezone. Those would be generated server-side, and would be the same items for every player. We're talking about tiny amounts of necessary items like a Pokeball, a Super Potion or a Berry, but no eggs nor evolutionary items. Picking up those items would remove them from the map, and the fact that they were picked up can be cached client-side to allow for faster start-up. 

Of course, picking up the item would trigger an API request to let the server know you picked up the item, to add the item to your bag, and to make sure you don't pick them up twice. To allow for the usual response latency, if the client app knows the item is being picked up, or was picked up, the request does not need to be sent again. It protects the servers from players tapping 50 times on an item to pick it up because response time is slow.

One interesting optimization about this feature is that the server does not have to keep those picked up states forever. Since the items disappear every day, a reference to what was picked up is ephemeral and serves no purpose aside from analytics passed 6AM every day. 

The player would need to get really close to the item to pick it up. This also allows a lot of flexibility for events and Easter Eggs (Voltorbs and Stunfisk, for instance). It also does not add a lot of server load. 

Over-world items would also encourage the players to explore other places that aren't specifically registered as POI. Taking walks in your neighborhood would become a different adventure every day, and you'd get many more opportunities to discover potential POI, making the average Wayfarer's contribution more valuable. 

Items would have to be spread out in a way that they're always close to a road (a.k.a. they don't appear in private residences). This adds a certain level of complexity from a development perspective, and would require ""forbidden"" areas. You could also make it the other way around, and only allow items to appear on the ""roads"" in the game. Wayfarer could also have the possibility to report certain items as unobtainable, and that would create a new zone where items cannot appear.

**Trainers**

As with the over-world items, NPC trainers would be added randomly on the map every day at 6AM until 10PM where trainers are not encouraged to go out. There would of course be a lot less trainers than over-world items.

Trainers would trigger a battle CTA when you walk close to them, but would allow you to decline. Walking too far from them without accepting the battle would also dismiss the battle CTA.

Unlike Rocket Grunts, NPC trainers would not necessarily have mono-type teams. They could instead have theme teams such as ""sun"", ""beach"", ""winter"", ""factory"", ""travel"", ""sewers"". In Pokemon games, you can usually guess the kind of opponent you'll be facing by looking at the sprite. 

This opens up so many opportunities for events, making it way more fun for the players, but also more lucrative for Niantic (compromises...) 

Winning a trainer battle would give XP, and a few healing items. Maybe sometimes rarer items like a Unova Stone, or a rare candy. Everyone would see the same trainers on the map, but the items dropped would vary (loot box style). Trainers could also have different drop rates depending on their trainer type (i.e. breeders would drop berries more often). There would be ""rare"" trainers as well, using a strong team, and giving away more XP or rarer items like there are rare Rocker Grunts using tougher teams. Those could be gym leaders from Pokemon games, for instance. Battling against Brock. That sounds rad.

I can already imagine the Pokemon GO email : ""Lookout for *engineers* trainers! They're said to be using electric Pokemon and will give you a rare candy if you win against them in a Pokemon Battle! If you're lucky, you might win a Unova Stone!""

**Other Niantic games**

To be completely honest, I have no clue how that would translate into Ingress or HPWU. From a business perspective, it makes a lot more sense to create a generic set of features, then implement them more concretely in each games. For us to see those kinds of features, Niantic would have to figure out a way to make those features reusable, or at least generic enough to allow for other kinds of implementations.

"I've recently seen a lot of posts asking questions of IVs and to be clear, this post is towards newer/more casual players and not high level veterans/hardcore players. 

My rule of thumb regarding IVs is this: 

If you are asking a question about IVs, don't worry about it yet and just keep an eye out for hundos (4\*) 

If you are a newer/casual player reading this, I would say to you this: evolve the higher level pokemon and don't worry about IVs just yet. Over time you will gain enough resources to be able to choose what you want to really invest in, and then you can worry about IVs. 

Why do I say this?

IVs really make a small difference between each pokemon. The people who are usually asking this are newer players/more casual players. And to them, the difference that IV gives is significantly outweighed by other factors (Like the actual pokemon or the level) for them. 

To these questions, I often hear the remark about how they should keep low attack IV mons for PvP or something similar to that. Do you really think that for these players, they have enough resources to evolve and/or power up the pokemon? And do they have enough resources to do that for 3 pokemon?

I would argue that optimising a team for PvP is one of the end games of Pokemon Go. 

Given that the meta of PvP is constantly changing, by the time that these players are finally up to a point where they would be thinking about optimising a team for PvP and are able to have the resources to do so, the meta of PvP would be completely different to what it is now.

Closing remarks: Now, I know that it might appear controversial, and no doubt I will probably get some comments about how people play the game differently to others. I'm just simply giving my two cents on the matter.

"Well, other than the 12km trash eggs, the other are almost impossible. If you do rocket battles regularly and don't walk enough.

Have a look at my eggs box:
https://imgur.com/a/hLyXQ9p

Now that I work from home, I don't go out and walk as often. Eggs are hatching at an agonizing rate of 1 per weeks.

So now that we're getting 12km eggs that goes over the 9 egg limit, here is how I got stuck:

1. I have at least 9 eggs, and I don't walk enough to hatch it
2. I fight grunts because hey they fly towards me in hot air balloons and occupy the pokestops right below my home. I don't have to walk to get to them.
3. I punch their bosses in their faces and they poop 12km eggs into my bag, now I have more than 9 eggs.
4. Return to 1., rinse and repeat.

Anyone see the issue here? At any time, I have more than 9 eggs, which means even if I hatch my current egg, I will not be able to get new eggs from pokestops and presents. To make things worse, all the new eggs I get will be 12km eggs because I'm only getting eggs from rocket bosses now. Which means I will be taking even longer to hatch what I already have. I can totally foresee at some point my entire egg box will become 12km eggs.

TL;DR new egg overflow system will force 12km eggs onto you, maxing out your egg box, disallowing you to get other eggs. It takes forever to hatch them, but you get a new 12km before you hatch the one you are hatching.",It is impossible to get new eggs now.,pokemongo

"Recently i got chosen to test the additional egg storage feature.. i basically really like the idea and it makes it way easier to receive eggs from go rocket bosses or adventure sync. BUT there are a two things i would definitely improve:

1. You should be able to move eggs from the additional storage to the normal one if you have space there. That would make it possible to always have space for a new egg. Otherwise you can only get e.g. 3 strange eggs and you have no other option to free up space than hatching. But i want to be able to collect 12 strange eggs or at least to collect more than 3 at a time. That would be really cool

2. Sometime one may not want to get a adventure sync egg. Maybe there should be a possibility to easily skip that one on mondays without having to block a slot in some way.

I realize Niantic is a business(a 4 billion dollar company) but I swear every other move they make is a backhanded way of getting more money from us.

From the looks of it they don‚Äôt take much constructive criticisms or provide helpful customer service.

Some Money makers:

Sponsored gifts

Frequent tickets (including the recent $12 one)

Capturing a raid Pok√©mon doesn‚Äôt seem to depend on skill or how you throw. Sometimes they just aren‚Äôt going to go in the pokeball. They really want us to buy more raid passes. 

Coming out with new legendaries all the time would be nice if I didn‚Äôt have to constantly pay a dollar for a new remote raid pass, or wait for niantic to possibly throw me a bone. Why not just put them in pokestops?

The 50 coins a day limit 

Lack of egg incubators

Lack of anything really if you live in a small town 

The fact that even if you‚Äôre best buddies you need a boatload of stardust to trade legendaries/shiny Pok√©mon 

Those overpriced ‚Äúboxes‚Äù in the shop

Lack of storage 



If you want to play the game seriously it‚Äôs really hard not to shell out some cash. Not even saying this stuff is unaffordable, it just feels gross sometimes. Niantic has a pretty loyal following and I don‚Äôt think they do enough for their players to validate the money they‚Äôre making.

I got to 11/12 on this task and the only reason I even got that close was because I had a couple of research rewards available that gave me a Pokemon encounter so if this comes up with any kind of regularity, I'll have to save those rewards to even have a chance of finishing task.

"For those that didn't notice, there's now space for three extra eggs, but those spaces can't be filled with Pok√©stop or gift eggs, they're for strange eggs or Adventure Sync eggs ONLY.

Which is great for people who were missing out on rewards they wanted!  Seriously, I'm really trying to be happy for those who consider this a good thing!

But I do not.  I was getting plenty of strange eggs, and they're difficult to hatch and clear out, so I don't really need to be getting more.  Worse, though, to me, are the Adventure Sync ""reward"" eggs, which I not only consider inferior to the Pok√©stop egg pool, but the act of receiving one of these eggs blocks you from getting rare candy or silver pinap rewards from Adventure Sync, both of which are far better than the eggs.  I have my fingers crossed that since they're now basically FORCING everyone to receive the eggs, that they'll now just give the candy and pinaps too.  But since this is Niantic I find myself doubting that?

If the eggs do still substitute for the other rewards, I probably will not be hatching ANY eggs next week, because that's going to be the only way to block the Adventure Sync eggs now.

Again, I'm trying to be happy for those celebrating the change.  I just really wish Niantic gave people a little more control over which eggs they do or don't receive, in general.","Is anyone else peeved about the ""extra"" egg slots?",pokemongo

"I am a casual player and have had very few problems with the pokemon community over the years, until now.

I recently moved to an area with only 1 gym. The first day I took it over from Valor to Mystic, slapped a blissey in and continued my day. 10 Hours later log in to see I had only gotten one coin. I thought maybe just bad luck so ill just recap it before I walk back home. I quickly take it back and its is immediately under siege. Its being attacked by 3 attackers so I don't try to defend. I note the name of the 3 owners who put in pokemon.

Next morning my wife and I wake up at 5am for a run and stop by the gym to try and get some coins. Start attacking and realize its being defended with golden berries. Its still only the same 3 pokemon. We decide to screw the run let's get this gym. After an hour of battling we were done. By our count they had used over 40 golden berries in that hour. We unfortunately realized that they had more golden berries than we had potions.

That evening on after dinner we decided to try one more time. It had been over 8 hours, no reason for this person to keep this gym. We got it! We put our pokemon in and waited to see if it would get attacked. After 10 minutes the siege started, we golden berried our pokemon for about 30 mins (using about 20 berries). We didn't want to sit out in the parking lot of a park any longer and left and let the gym fall.

This same behavior has gone on for a week, we have lost interest in even trying at this point. Its sad that one obnoxious spoofer (has been reported) can ruin the game due to poor game design.

&amp;#x200B;

I need 100 characters here so I'll make this two posts in one, I have a gripe about the ways to access mega energy. Currently, there are three ways to get mega energy.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Raiding
2. Walking
3. Field Research

&amp;#x200B;

1. Raiding

&amp;#8203;

    This is the easiest and fastest way but is annoying because you have to wait for mon to loop back around in raids and even then you'll need other people to finish the raid with you, which can be difficult.
    
    2. Walking
    Walking is another way you can get mega energy but my main gripe is that you need to have previously mega evolved that mon to be able to get mega energy when walking with it which is dumb because the only reason I'm walking with this is to get mega energy. I propose they change this and make it something small, maybe 5 or 10 mega energy per candy distance.
    
    3. Field Researches 
    The field researches for mega energy are not that common and even when you do find them, most of the time you will get the Beedrill mega energy quest which I understand they need to make it rare but it is still annoying.

It's incredibly annoying and can be time-consuming to have to wipe my screen off between each throw if I want to go out and play in bad weather.

Anyways, it occurred to me that a catch stabilization feature would be a great optional addition to the game. You'd still have to aim and throw the balls, but if you chose to switch it on, maybe they'd just come out less shaky, more in the direction they were clearly intended to go.

"I've done research but it's all from 2019 so not sure how much has changed regarding mewtwo and builds. 
He has 14 attack, 13 defense and 8 health and 921 CP. 

Is he worth investing in? I'm not sure how easy it is to farm Giovanni. 

If he is, how do I remove frustration, is it still tied to rocket events or something? 

Should I purify or does him being shadow benefit me in raids or hinder because I take more damage?

Should I save him for now but farm a hundo? Or just get one with better health or is attack/def all I need to focus on?

If he's trash, is fighting giovanni as simple as beat all 3 leaders to get the upgrade rocket finder? I've only recently been beating them so I'm still learning.

And not only that. There wasn't a single encounter quest to be found, a shame really. And since the spawns ar split into 2 days during the 6hours.

"The candy rate for feeding berries should be substantially increased. 

Reasons:

- more candy from feeding makes holding gyms more worth it

-increased incentive to hold gyms encourages gym turnover which is needed in a lot of areas

-berry feeding system is underutilized outside of golden razz for motivation and Niantic has clearly recognized this based on increased stardust reward per berry on recent update

-nanab berries have long been underutilized, which again, Niantic clearly recognized based on recent buff. This gives added value to berries in general, but especially lesser used berries

-promotes gym diversity. I think that was part of the idea for the current gym system, but in practice it seems like people don‚Äôt really care anymore and opt to throw in whatever random shiny they want to show off or the first thing they click on. 


Practical implementation:

-10 berry per hour limit, candy guaranteed every 20th berry +\- random candy at current or adjusted rate (feel free to debate the numbers, just tried to give a reasonable estimate)

-each berry increases motivation 1/10 of 1 stage, so feeding 10 berries to something with bottomed out motivation means an attacker has to ko your pokemon twice to kick it out of the gym (goal to make regular berries have a more substantial effect on motivation without diminishing importance of golden razz)

-timer displayed that lets you know when you can feed berries again

Anyways, I've become frustrated with the app, like I've seen from a few people on here already. I'm frustrated over the fact that you can only get 50 coins per day when your pokemon return from gyms. From a business standpoint, sure they want to make more money, so they would find ways to limit our intake of coins. What I don't get though, is that getting remote raid passes or even extra balls require coins to purchase. Whats worse is that storage upgrades. You pay so many coins just for 50 storage slots. Thats hardly anything for an active player. I've been playing on and off since the game first launched, and I'm pretty sure storage upgrades used to give you 100 more slots. Also, I find it real dumb that you can't buy berries. With the new Pokemon home link, they gave people a mystery box thing, but you pretty much need an equal amount of pinap berries of balls in order to even come close to achieving the 400 candies you need to evolve the Meltan that come out of it.

It sucks so much having to kill 1000 stunfisks, galvantua, obstagoon, skarmory, hypno and azumaril. I want to face off against new and fun teams. I personally run a lapras, shiny skarmory and shiny sceptile. I at least try to mix things up.

What the battle league needs is the ability for you to ban 3-5 pokemon which you refuse to face off against. It would force people to look for more interesting combos since their queue times would probably be longer and it would also give me an ability to enjoy battling there. So if i've faced off 7 games in a row against one pokemon, i can just ban it because i've gotten bored of facing off against it all the time.",Mid-High level battle league sucks because of meta teams,pokemongo

"Hi guys, so I want to show you guys my story on how much I wasted my time, Pokeballs, and my Pokemon storage after when I was trying to shiny hunt male Nidoran during the timed research event. Even though that timed research event was pretty brilliant.

But anyway, here's the story.

So, the notification popped out at my iPhone 5S and I found out that it was Nidoran Timed Research Event. I was pretty impressed about that because it was my chance to earn a second Shiny Meltan throughout in the Pokemon Shield trade with another person after he told me to give him both shiny male and female Nidorans. So far, he said that he was going to clone them and give me back my shiny Nidorans.

So, I jumped into my main account Pokemon Go and started the research adventure to start the shiny hunting both male and female. However, the hardest part was the nice and excellent throws. I was trying to throw the Pokeballs into the target and some throws were pretty bad and wasteful. Worst of all, the fucking streams were broken and useless and all my hard work has been fucking wasted by those stupid and laggy streams. 

So, I moved to another account after my Pokeballs are completely wasted and gone and when I was to finish one step, the female Nidoran ran into me and I ran from it. But, all of a sudden, the reward encounter just disappeared and I couldn't even get into the reward encounters. I became really furious about what just happened to me. I couldn't even find one single male Nidoran who would approach me. So, I gave up my hunt after the huge struggle. Luckily, I still have an only female Nidoran in my Pokemon Shield file.

So, thanks to those broken events, I had to soft reset all the evolutions of Nidorans (except the female Nidoran) in my Pokemon Shield file.

Unless if someone would trade me a shiny male Nidoran, then I would get a Shiny Meltan trade completed and sorted out. But no, I had failed my goal for a trade.

Anyway, for me, that event was really broken and pointless for me to shiny hunt both male and female Nidorans in Pokemon Go.",My luck was unfortunately struggled to complete the perfect research.,pokemongo

Everything I've tried to look up on this has made me believe something is off with my account, and I've contacted support about 20 times on the subject and never had the same reaction twice, usually claiming I'm lying or I did my encounter already, so why am I complaining.

"Hi guys, I'm going to tell you a story about my struggle during the Shiny Wooper event.

&amp;#x200B;

So, yesterday, a notification just popped up onto my notification centre and it featured the Wooper spawns along with a chance of Shiny one. So, I opened my third account and started hunting for Shiny Wooper by using a 2-hour incense. Unfortunately, I was really concerned that I didn't run into the shiny one in one single encounter as I wasted all my incenses. I was thinking that the shiny rates were really fucked up like a rip-off.

But today, I was trying to hunt a shiny one in my second account before the event would end. Unfortunately, my luck has been struggling really bad and I nearly wasted my incenses for 2-hour straight. So, I was really frustrated on the outside and upset on the inside in my heart because of the most fucked up shiny rates. I thought my hometown is not a good place to shiny hunt in Pokemon Go and my phone doesn't even have data anymore in order for me to freely walk around for Shiny Wooper.

Well, guys, that's the story about the Game Awards event about Shiny Wooper.  I felt so depressed and sad that I didn't find one single Shiny Wooper in my Pokemon Go accounts. 

Now thanks to those shitty ass low shiny rates of Wooper, I had to give up my Registeel hunt in Crown Tundra and soft reset on Wooper in my Pokemon Shield file. Unless someone would help trade a Shiny Wooper in Pokemon Sword and Shield.

But, I had to say that this event should've been a community day instead of that Game Awards one and I hope that the other events with their shiny rates were not terrible next time.","Welp, my luck has been terrible lately.",pokemongo

"An earlier post about being able to set character goals kind of like the level-up requirements for 40+ inspired this idea, but what would you guys thing about Niantic introducing a system where you can choose a trainer specialization? Kind of like the original games where you'd face themed trainers like Hikers, Swimmers, Ace Trainers, Psychics, etc.

I think it'd be cool to have a system where you could choose to pursue one of those paths which would have goal-gated progress (i.e., catch 500 fire Pokemon to reach level 2 Hothead) and achieving higher levels down the path would unlock themed cosmetic items, catch or damage bonuses for Pokemon of the related type, etc. For people who don't want to commit to a single type, they could use Ace Trainers as like an all-rounder option.

And just to keep it from being a burden to min-maxers, I'd propose setting it up so you could change specializations like once a week, keeping progress in your old specialization but locking the rewards until you re-enabled it.

"Hello again,
I forgot I had another question but it's subject is so different I figured I'd put it as a different post.
Is there any unwritten rules or anything on opening gifts when you and your friend are close to hitting a new friendship level?  Or maybe just what is considered good etiquette regarding this?
With the recent boost to friendship advancement I've got 4 to 6 friends with whom I'm about to hit max level.  I'd love to be able to do that with all of them at once. That way I could make sure I had a luck egg activated and only need to use one. But I also don't want to be rude and hold back other people's progress.
What do other people do?
Also, by waiting I can avoid missing out on having an egg active altogether. Several times I've had the pop up screen showing a friendship increase come up unexpectedly when triggered by the other player.
Is there any way to either avoid this happening or find out before hand so I can activate a lucky egg first?

I need advice on whether or not to purify some mons.

I have some that would become 100% if purified, which would be nice to have. I'm also aware of the 20% boost shadow mons get. But I figure not all mons are worthy of keeping shadowed, regardless of IV.

- Magnemite 98% and 87%

I know this one is worth keeping shadowed, but I wonder if I'd make a mistake be purifying the 98% to get a 100%, while keeping the 87% shadowed.

- Other high IV shadow mons that would be 100% if purified
 - Wobbuffet 96%
 - Omanyte 96%
 - Electabuzz 96%
 - Koffing 96%
 - Lapras 93% (I have an 89% also, that won't be 100%)

"Although it was only implemented for a very short period of time (around 3 maybe 4 comm days mid 2020), the feature where your buddy would bring you 50 pokeballs every half an hour (for a total of 300 over the 6 Hour Comm Day) enabled people who live in pokestop sparse regions like myself (and many others) to actually enjoy comm days without the fear of running out of balls. There is also the pandemic to think off and most people wont or cant commute to more pokestop dense public spaces to play.

Now i know it was pretty buggy from all the reddit posts where people would complain about the buddy bugging out and not bringing the balls and this probably increased supports workload by a magnitude but overall i think it was a more positive feature compared to the 30 ultraball bundle which we get now (which is also great btw, im not complaining niantic, pls dont take it away) because you would rather play and and not run out of pokeballs till hour 3-4 than run out in the first hour itself

Quick question, are Shadow Pok√©mon universally better than regular or purified Pok√©mon of the same species, when it comes to PvP effectiveness, when they have similar rank percentiles via Poke Genie (known moves, stardust/candy costs, etc aside).
For instance, if I have a Shadow Dunsparce that Poke Genie says is in the 98th percentile for Great League and a regular Dunsparce also in the 98th Percentile for GL, is the shadow better because of the bonuses it gets (I'm not even sure what the bonuses are. I think it's an attack bonus.).

"This isn't some sort of cathartic experience I wanted to pass on.

But I think there could be room for growth in game. 

Every since research tasks came a out, we could see that progress could be tracked real time, with an update that we've caught 1 of 10 pokemon or what have you. With the lvl 40+ tasks, we see progress on a larger scale.

Wouldn't it be awesome if we could set goals for ourselves with an ingame mechanic? Let's say i want to earn X amount of experience or stardust, or even a specific mon Candy. Well pull out the e-counter and get an update every time you catch a mon or battle in a gym..

"Hello All-

So I have decided to make the grind to level 40 before January 1st, to get all the special items. I started at level 35 on December 4th at 35 and am currently at level 36 (100k from 37). My plan has been the following so far, but looking for more advice-

\[In The Morning\]

1. First thing in the morning drop a Lucky Egg
2. Make first spin at Pokestop and continue to get gifts
3. Hand out gifts to all friends if possible
4. Make first catch 5\* Raid Battle (20k EXP)
5. Friends from the night before return gifts (1 heart) - 6k a piece
6. Go around and collect Pokeballs
7. Return home, drop an incent / 2 lucky eggs
8. Catch everything for the next hour or until I run out of Pokeballs
9. Evolve everything while using the luck eggs for extra EXP

\[In The Evening\]

1. Drop a Lucky Egg
2. Spin Pokestops to get more gifts
3. Continue to give friends gifts until everyone has been given one
4. Continue looking for 5\* Raid Battle (20k EXP)
5. Make sure before returning home that I have 20 gifts
6. Look through Friend list and get rid of anyone over 2 hearts (sorry friends)
7. Put name on Friend Lists websites
8. Everyone that becomes a new friend, immediately give them a gift (when the reciprocate 6k exp)
9. At 11:59pm shut down the app and wait to start the morning routine again

That is what I have been doing so far, and it has been working pretty well. Any suggestions from anyone else?

"I wish someone wrote this review when I was considering buying it, so I‚Äôm writing it now myself:

A pokemon Go-Tcha is a third party automatic pokestop and pokemon gym spinner and an automatic pokemon catcher.

It functions similarly to Niantic‚Äôs own Pokemon Go Plus or the newer Poke Ball Plus, with a few key differences.

The Pokemon Go-Tcha is paired to the Pokemon Go game as if it was a Pomemon Go Plus device. Your game will think it is a Pomemon Go Plus.

When you turn on the Pokemon Go-Tcha and pair it, it‚Äôll start a Pokemon Go Plus session. That session will last somewhere between 30 minutes and 60 minutes if your phone screen is off. At the end of that period, the Pokemon Go session will end and you‚Äôll get a notification stating as such. the Go-Tcha will stop doing anything. You can turn it on again to start a new session. The session will also end if the Go-Tcha loses bluetooth connection to the phone or if it‚Äôs low on battery. It also sometimes loses connection for no good reason.

During the session, the Go-Tcha will spin pokestops, spin pokemon gyms, and catch pokemon. It will always prioritize catching pokemon to spinning. So, if there are 3 pokemon and a stop, it will first attempt to catch all 3 pokemon and then spin the stop. That being said, it doesn‚Äôt always follow its own priority and often seems to have a mind of its own.

When a Go-Tcha attempts to catch a pokemon, it will throw one and only one pokeball at it. It cannot use great balls or ultra balls. It cannot use berries. It will not make nice or great throws. It will not make curvethrows. It will throw exactly 1 regular pokeball with a regular throw and no bonuses. It either catches the pokemon with that one throw, or the pokemon runs away. No second chances with a Go-Tcha.

Understandably, that makes the catch rate low. Much lower than any player would reasonably get. I think I read 50% catch rate somewhere, which seems about right although I have not calculated it myself.

Also, you will run out of regular pokeballs quickly. Your pokemon storage will fill up quickly as well. For it to really work well, you need to have an abundance of pokeballs in stock, and also have plenty of vacant pokemon storage for it to fill.

If you have a Go-Tcha, you‚Äôll want to keep pokeballs for the Go-Tcha and you‚Äôll want to keep ultra balls for when you play and catch pokemon yourself. Great balls are usually discarded.

If your inventory is full, it won‚Äôt spin stops. If you don‚Äôt have pokeballs left, I have seen it keep complaining and not doing anything altogether. It won‚Äôt even spin stops if you‚Äôre out of pokeballs which makes no sense but that‚Äôs how it is.

There are settings in the device. You can turn each of the following on or off separately: spin stops and gyms, catch pokemon in your pokedex, catch new pokemon, vibrate. I once wanted it to only spin and not catch cause I was low on items. It ended up not doing anything at all. I reset the settings multiple times, unpaired and paired, cycled through them. Mine just seemed to not want the settings played with. If I turned catching off, it would not spin anything either. It has a mind of its own.

It is not a rugged device. Not in its software or its hardware. I have had it go nuts on me twice now in only a few months. I fixed it by disconnecting and completely unpairing it from my device, then pairing it again. It‚Äôll also sometimes disconnect for no reason. It does not have a battery indicator, so there‚Äôs no way to tell if it‚Äôs low on battery or not.

This may seem to be a bad review, but it isn‚Äôt. The Go-Tcha is great and game-changing. The game is completely different with it. I am drowning in items and stardust and pokemon and candy, especially for common pokemon.

So how do I use it?

I run in a local park most mornings. I take it with me and turn it on before I start the run. I check on it once every 20-30 minutes to make it hasn‚Äôt disconnected. Since that park is full of pokemon and pokestops, I‚Äôll have 50 to 400 new pokemon in an hour. I know the range is huge. They all add stardust as well, you can do the stardust math. But I‚Äôll be 100-600 pokeballs short. Again, I know the range is huge. I make sure that I have 100 to 200 free inventory storage at the beginning. The pokeball throwing frees up more space during the run.

Also, I turn the Go-Tcha in my commute to and from work, as well as while running errands. When I‚Äôm back home, I‚Äôll have maxed out the gifts I can carry, collected some items, caught some pokemon and got a bit of stardust.

I went from rarely having more than 100k stardust to always having a few to several hundred thousands, despite being much more generous with powering up pokemon.

I am also swamped by items. I went from struggling to maintain a stock of balls and other items to throwing all great balls, throwing all revives except for a small amount of max revives, same thing with potions and only keeping 500 ultra balls and throwing the rest away. My gym defending pokemon are now obese from the amount of berries I feed them. Two birds with one stone: I free up inventory and throw away items I don‚Äôt need, plus it gives me stardust and the occasional candy.

Bottom line is, I would recommend using a Go-Tcha. But you should be aware of the cons before buying. The best use is for it to spin and catch while you passively go about your business. You‚Äôll need to check on it once every 30-60 minutes. You‚Äôll need to periodically free up storage space and mass transfer pokemon. It‚Äôs best if you buy plenty of inventory and pokemon storage. It will go crazy on you about once a month and require a full reset. It‚Äôll sometimes disconnect randomly. The settings will sometimes mess up randomly.

But it works. It does work.",My review of Pokemon Go-Tcha,pokemongo

Occasionally I do see an odd Pokemon out of these select few, but it‚Äôs been about a week and is already repetitive, which makes me extremely pessimistic thinking of the next 3 months of these spawns alone, outside of events.

The evolutions are nice, but I feel like if they keep the seasons like this, most of the Pokemon spawns we see are locked outside of events. I have a great Medicham to power up with rare candies, but I am yet to see one in quite a while, and now that they don‚Äôt nest, what am I suppose to do?

Here are a handful of Pokemon I‚Äôm yet to see in a while: Caterpie, Zubat, Oddish, Murkrow, Maril, Meditite, Chikorita, Sudowoodo, Hoppip, Sunkern, Yanma, Tailow, Wingull, Skitty, Sableye, Spoink, Lileep, Barboach, Shieldon, Snivy, Patrat, Lillipup, Slowpoke, Ponyta, Venipede, Spearow, Nidorans, Rattata, Ekans, Psyduck, Meowth, Bellsprout, Magnemite, Doduo, Dunsparce, Gligar, Aipom, Ledyba, Drowzee, Staryu, Execggute, Natu, Spinarak, Snubull, Zigzagoon, Wurmple, Shroomish, Mankey, Slugma, Cubone, Omanyte, Kabuto, Cyndaquil, Shuckle, Houndour, Mudkip, Lotad, Whismur, Plusle, Minun, Swablu, Roselia, Carvanha, Spoink, Baltoy, Skorupi, Hippo, Oshawatt, Tympole, Dweeble, Shelmet, and many many others.
(I probably misspelled a lot) 

Obviously they aren‚Äôt the best Pokemon in the game, but I‚Äôm making a point and you probably didn‚Äôt have to  read it all to get that point. Some of them do spawn in the other hemisphere when it switched, but it‚Äôs maybe 10-15 of them? 

I‚Äôm aware this is how seasons are suppose to be and I know I may seem a bit picky, but it seems boring to go from a wise variety of spawns, to a narrow selection of 20-30. For a quarter of the year, I‚Äôm missing out on 100s of Pokemon and at this point it‚Äôs making Pokemon Go boring outside of events, and extremely repetitive. 

I know some may disagree based on what biomes are around and which season you‚Äôre in, however, with COVID it‚Äôs been difficult to explore and find different Pokemon. Again, this is based on my personal experience and various other users in my area. I know they are making many many changes, so this may not be permanent, but I keep thinking it will stay permanent and thought I could vent a bit.

" 

Most of us are not ultra hardcore players but with the XP boost month and lots of players grinding hard for the legacy 40 and for level 50, I think NIantic should give us bundle of pokeballs with more than just ""50"" ultra balls since 50 ultra balls are not enough at all for a 6 h CD and that too back to back days, the 50 ultra balls barely last for 1 h gameplay tbh..

With the XP boost and many of us grinding hard due to the really great 2000+ xp from excellent throws , pokeballs have become much needed commodity now and CDs are usually the best chances for casuals and F2P players to grind hard due to the 3X incense effectiveness,

I hope Niantic will do something about this instead of just handing us 50 ultra balls , since i feel most of us will ran out from pokeballs and they will not be sufficient enough to utilise both the CD at our full potential even if we open all 30 giftts

Best solution imo wil be our buddy brining us 50 pokeballs every 30 mins or even 1h , even if its just normal balls . It will be really really appreciated.

Tbh i feel really sad to be asking for such basic item like pokeball which no players should be made to ask just to have an optimal minimum gameplay experience","since we are having back to back community days &amp; most of us are at home, I think we should get more than just ""50 ultra box "" for the 2 upcoming CDs",pokemongo
"I don‚Äôt know if anyone would actually like this or maybe it would be too much work program but I was thinking it‚Äôd be cool if they released Manaphy and Phione through a special event where they introduce a Ranger like Professor Willow and we‚Äôre given a Capture Styler. The Styler and a special box would then be added as items like Meltan box and one could choose to activate the Styler which adds the option next to the buddy icon bottom left for a limited time.

If you wanted to befriend a Pok√©mon on the map rather than clicking on it to move to the catch screen, you would click on the Styler icon next to the buddy icon and draw circles around the Pok√©mon you see on the map. Buddy perks could play a role in making catching easier like in the Ranger game.

All the captured mons would be transferred to a box like Meltan box where we could choose which one to try to capture old school. Complete the research tasks this way and get the egg! Walk and hatch Manaphy, among the rewards of hatching Manaphy would be catching Phione.

"You know how there is the battle league with cp ceilings and all that jazz and that you will usually see only certain types of pokemon in that bracket such as:

Under 1500: Stunfisk, Azumarill, Skarmory,Alolan marowak, etc

Under 2500:  You probably get the point.

The thing that would be great is if They made it so that You can still put a 3000cp mon In the &lt;1500 cp fights. How you might ask? Simple. EXACTLY HOW EVERY POKEMON GAME DID IT. By adjusting their stats to the 1500 cp when they participate and Re putting it back up after the battle. 

What is more fair in your opinion? Having access to your full arsenal of mons like your Hydreigon, your Lucarios, your gyaradosses,etc AND your opponnent has the same 

OR you having evolved your 3 star magikarp after 400 candy grind and turning out that you can't freaking use it in 2500 cp battles because it just happened to have 5cp above the threshhold, WHILE there is this mofo who managed to get a 3star charizard under 1500 cp. 

This would bring A LOT more diversiciation to the battles as I'm freaking bored of having to deal with countless Azumarrils, Alolan marowak, Galarian stunfisk(Freaking broken piece of sh*t),Skarmories and the very rare but deadly 1499 cp Altaria. 

Also ffs the switching mecanic is pretty bad.  It's imo the hardest part to balance in this mess. On one hand if you lose the first type battle and you switch and he has another kon to counter that it's gg 2 mons down for free and on the other hand you got switching fiesta.

How important are stars?

I see it like this : 

1. 3-5 maximum Great Gifts slots in inventory
2. They would give better items (1-2 rare candies, great balls minimum, max revives/potions and maybe even a TM in a rare case and/or evolution items)
3. They would be acquirable only from a gym that you have GOLD and only one Great gift per gym per day so you'd have to go to your GOLD gyms in order to get them every day. 
4. They would increase friendship by 2 days once opened by your friend (2 interactions) 
5. That would let you increase friendship a little faster with someone you're really wanting to be best friends with sooner (like a IRL friend)
6. It would give you something worthwhile to motivate GOLD'ing gyms around your neighborhood other than a medal
7. They could possibly give a 10km egg (20% chance) if you have an open slot
8. Would encourage caring about friends and sending them better gifts to show appreciation and kindness

"This is like... a Complaint/Discussion/Idea with a LOT of reading if you want to dare.

We've entered the situation I feared from the beginning. 

There are now so many pokemon just available, that it's hard to find a number of pokemon just because the RNG pool is so big. And I'm not exactly saying that rare pokemon shouldn't be rare, but the ratio to super common to uncommon is incredibly abysmal. 

EX: Apart from nests (which is a different RNG happenstance), finding an Omanyte in a pool of 140 pokemon is a lot easier than finding an Omanyte in a pool of over 550. That's simple math of the matter. 

**We reached the point where there's this sense of ""If you don't get this pokemon during its featured release, good luck finding it ever again"" issue.** 

\&gt;&gt;An Example I'd argue is right now. Froakie was immensely difficult to find. I don't know what the reasoning behind that was. Or if the RNG just... didn't play to Froakie's favor, or what. I found tons of Chespin, not many Fennekin, and.. 5? Froakie? And not all of them I caught. I think I caught 3 maybe.

And since the Kalos event ended yesterday. I've see both Chespin and Fennekin, and no Froakie. This may change in the coming week. Give it more than a day, I know.

\&gt;&gt;Deino is another pokemon  players have been frustrated about. Deino was advertised for the Dragon Week that was earned from Go Fest and there was little to no Deino in the wild (at least where I was) during said event. I don't remember catching any apart from research. But it also took... a good few weeks to find a Deino in the first place when it was released. I don't remember when it was released, but I was living in Tokyo at the time, and I could NOT find one. I randomly saw one 'near' my apartment at like.. 11 PM one night. It was close enough so I went to go get it. Didn't see another one for the rest of the time I was in Tokyo. Never saw Axew

Take a second to understand. Tokyo. Which has a massive population playing that game, and there are pokemon everywhere. There are tons of stops (especially because 7 Eleven is a sponsored stop and they are as frequent as we joke about Starbucks being in New York. On top of all their other sponsored stops). I've found less than 5 since coming home. And that's including the Dragon Week in that timeframe.

Pokemon Go was literally the only thing I did there too since I didn't really have friends there to hang out with and I had 3 free days a week.

Other examples of Pokemon that... just disappeared and I've seen.... MAYBE once since an event:

&amp;#x200B;

|Emolga|Ducklett|Solosis|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Gothita (minus the recent event with it boosted a little bit)|Archen (have never caught. Only hatched until this last event)|Elgyem|
|Tirtouga|Petilil|Sewaddle|

Not to mention the pokemon I haven't seen noticeably in the wild or.. anywhere in months

&amp;#x200B;

|Mankey|Krabby|Voltorb|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Lickitung|horsea|Goldeen (until the Lake Trio)|
|Kabuto (though always harder to find than Omanyte|Spinarak|Aipom|
|Hoppip|Wooper (until recent event)|Shuckle|
|Slugma|Remoraid (until recent event)|Stantler|
|Lotad|Nincada (though that was never really... a non-special)|Electrike|
|Carvanha|Numel|Korphish|
|Anorith|Finneon||

&amp;#x200B;

I'm taking out the ones that return every year. (Obviously the new pokemon have yet to return ""next year""

ALso.. I might have been unobsservant, but usually I tap the pokemon i find that I haven't seen in some time. Like When Wooper came back I tapped on it cause I knew I hadn't seen one in a LONG while.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I wrong to compare Sewaddle as a basic bug pokemon in the same standings as Weedle, Wurmple, Caterpie? Like the starter area bug pokemon? I'd include Ledyba and Spinarak, but I know they haven't been around that much in game, so I can't consider them ""pokemon go common""

But we have about 600 pokemon available in game. And I know at times they change the rarity of what pokemon spawn at times at the base level. (though with the massive amounts of events, sometimes that's hard to really tell what the base spawns are). But they don't adjust it very well at all honestly. 

Flipping through the Pokedex, I can see double the amount of Kanto available vs the amount of other region available. So Kanto has like 12, and the other regions barely rack up 4 of 5. But also just the ratio that the kanto pokemon spawn. I see SOOOOOOO many weedles. compared to other common bugs. I see SOOO many more pidgeys than other birds like Pidove or Starly.

Not to mention the ones that had basically dropped off the map entirely until recently. Like Hoothoot and Goldeen. Goldeen was incredibly common upon release (at least where I was living).

And I'm trying to be fair about this complaint. I don't live in a super city anymore, and I get that in more rural areas that certain pokemon tend to spawn more than others. The balance is just not there.

At the same time, they do do some seasonal pokemon. Like Delibird. Delibird only comes out for holidays. Yanmask. I'm really hoping that this ""Seasonal Event"" that they are doing sticks around and really pushes a real rotation of pokemon.

I think what would work well if is they made a number of groupings in which they shrink the pool down to about 6 groups (by continent?) and those cycle throughout the year. Maybe Kanto pokemon are more widely seen in Europe while Johto pokemon are seen in North America. Obviously the groups should be balanced and approximately equal. And the rotation resets every year. So In a year, each region will see the cycle of all the pokemon in 2 month rotations.

To offset the problem I've been talking about. Maybe any pokemon released in game for the last year aren't in the rotations. So Any pokemon in January 2020 released, are available everywhere until 2021 when they get put into said rotations.

It ""kind of"" makes all pokemon regional? But... At the same time, the main ones all go around the world. And I would say that 2 month is a decent amount of time to get excited with the new set, to then get bored enough when a new rotation is about to start. Obviously they can keep the region specific ones where they are. I've accepted that I'm never going to Africa for a Tropius, even though I REALLY want one.

 So eventually... 932 total pokemon (counting Alola?). In 6 groups is 155. Take out the legendaries, actual regionals, mythicals.... 125 per group. Which would similarly be like when they released the game. And obviously... the evolutions don't tend to spawn for most pokemon. Take out so many evolutions and you've got a good 85 to worry about. Probably less. Not saying to take them out of the rotation, but I'm not running around looking for Persian or Magnezone.

I don't think that's horrible. Very doable. And Pokemon go is releasing pokemon faster than main games are being released. And if they really wanted to, they could just keep a set of pokemon available everywhere all the time while rotating the rest more effectively.

So with this Seasonal event right now, I really hope it's a test to see if they can effectively implement this kind of idea. And I hope they can implement a way to have most to all pokemon available in some way.",We have definitely entered the Era of Pokemon Go I feared...,pokemongo

"Look, we all love this game, but Niantic's attempts and failures to encourage safe and feasible gameplay throughout this pandemic have been incredibly frustrating. The egg system has been broken since the start, and micromanaging egg slots is a chore that could be easily eliminated with an option to turn eggs on/off (similar to how players can enable/disable AR). Recently, this sub has been flooded with grievances about the implementation of the Kalos Pok√©mon, from their lack of availability, to their inanely low catch rates.

Though some may claim Niantic responds to user feedback, it's become very apparent they have little to no incentive to do so, as the game is highly profitable, and simply a stepping stone to developing other AR-centered apps and games. **The easiest way to communicate with a company is via our wallets, by keeping them closed until content is largely fixed and improved to our liking.** Remember, their freemium model means that we, as players, have neither invested nor committed to this app. It is their responsibility to develop an app that we are willing to pay for and fund for further new content.

Unfortunately, the big-spending whales will downvote this post, or simply ignore me. That's why I need you, the 99%, to join me in sending a powerful message that Niantic cannot ignore.

Like most of you, I too will simply scan my feet to earn a lackluster, 2-star dratini from the scan field research. **This upcoming community day, let's all scan and upload still frame videos of our bare butt cheeks.** You don't even need a field research task to do so, just be within range of a pokestop.

"So I finally got the Go-tcha, and it took a bit to figure out, but I have it down. I have to say this thing is stupid wet when used right. I go by a lot of stops on my way to work, and having rode as a passenger on a similar route, there is a lot of item potential. I had it on a mount to kind of see in action with peripherals, and it was hitting almost every stop I drove by. One trip netted me over 200 items. I also noticed that even while going 40 mph at times (most of the drive is 30 or less), Pokemon were spawning. Tried having catches on for that (turned them off to focus on heavy Pokestop areas), and it was snagging things even at that speed (some were running away though). My one gripe is I swear this thing does not fit in the wristband lol. I have tried and I don't want to risk breaking it just to get it in. I ordered some of the Keychains, hopefully it fits those. So, anyone who took the time to read this and has one...

-Does the wristband aspect just suck?

-Is this thing actually effective when driving? Mainly at higher speeds? (I know it does work when slower, which is most of my commute)

"I've recently been thinking about what potential future community days we could have in 2021, including when we could get the Unova starters, when/if we'll get the final 1 or 2 Pokemon from the unreleased voting datamines (which would need something to substitute for Magikarp now), and just other Pokemon that could work well for community days, outside the usual desired suspects like Gible, Litwick, etc. (who I still obviously want). A prime candidate that came to mind was¬†Spheal, a Pokemon who doesn't have its shiny released, is a three-stage evolution line with nothing weird about it or any counterpart lines. Just seems very likely, and I honestly was expecting it for November Community Day, but I'm willing to put money on it that it'll happen sometime in 2021 or at least be put in a voting poll in the future.

Spheal seems like a neat little community day. New shiny and likely some move that would make Walrein better for PvP. But then it got me thinking... why is it just Walrein who gets to shine during this potential community day? And... how much COULD it shine? Walrein is... pretty bad in PvP, with charge moves especially that are pretty meh, despite being able to learn great ones in the MSG. And funny enough, these good PvP moves that it can learn ARE learned by Sealeo, its middle evolution. So let's say Walrein gets one of those good moves for CD, say powder snow. It's good now right? Nope not really. That would certainly help it but it's not good. I'd still go for Sealeo because all its moves are special. Emphasis on ALL. See where I'm going with this? Walrein's Community day couldn't really just have one move. Even a brand new move like Ice Ball, even if it were really good, probably wouldn't propel the Pokemon that far up. It needs better moves in general.

So what's the solution? No, I am not at all suggesting we have multiple exclusive Community Day moves for a single Pokemon. Evolve your Sealeo into a Walrein to get one that knows Powder Snow and Ice Ball? Nope nope! Instead, I'm suggesting something that's actually been done before on a Community Day and something that I really would like to see more of with other CD Pokemon. Remember Blaziken Community Day? Evolve a Torchic up to get a Blaziken with Blast Burn. Pretty normal, but this day also had Blaziken receiving Blaze Kick as a permanent addition to its moveset. Walrein's PvP relevance with its community day would likely be laughable if they proceed how they've treated most other Pokemon, but add Powder Snow and maybe even another charge move to its moveset like Body Slam, Rock Slide, or Surf and have its exclusive move be Ice Ball and people would be much more hyped for the CD beyond its shiny release.

You read the title probably though. I said fully flesh out the featured Pokemon LINES, so I am not only talking about the final evolutions. Let's jump back to Walrein. Walrein gets Ice Ball, very nice, but who's to say Sealeo couldn't get the special move as well so it too could shine even more? Is it necessary? Nope. However, as I said it could really flesh out the whole Pokemon line. Especially if Niantic ignored Walrein's mediocre moveset and simply plopped Ice Ball on it and left it that way, wouldn't it still be great to have Sealeo, the good one, get a little boost that would actually be somewhat relevant? Let's ditch the hypotheticals, and let me throw an example that we had fairly recently: PORGYON! Porygon received its community day recently to praise. Yay we got the cool Pokemon with its cool shiny. In the PvP realm though... Tri Attack barely did anything for Porygon Z. It's not an amazing move in itself, but it helped Z a little, yet Porygon Z is atrocious with this move, and this time it's mostly not just because of its moves, but because Z is just less suited for PvP. Its bulkier middle evolution, however, Porygon2, is very much suited for PvP, and it could have saw some decent play if it received Tri attack, yet it didn't receive it because only the final evolution receives the move! Right? Wrong! While fairly useless... remember Surf Pikachu? A novelty, but it's not something Raichu ever even learned upon evolution. Remember Eevee learning Last Resort? Its evolutions all also kept Last Resort as well when evolved. These ideas aren't really new, but instead they're just criminally underused.

But okay, here's something that hasn't been done yet for Community Days, mostly because we've really only had a single taste of a repeat Community Day so far with Charmander. I'm just going to say it, if we are repeating a Community Day Pokemon who had a day with their shiny odds boosted to \~1/20, one new move doesn't cut it. Repeat CDs are enjoyable for some, especially those who missed out on the first, but many find them underwhelming. Charmander CD 2020 should have had BOTH its community day moves featured, Dragon Breath AND Blast Burn. A repeat day is more underwhelming, so make it less by giving the mon BOTH its special moves. Nobody wouldn't like that. If you don't want Dragon Breath then TM it away. If you don't want Blast Burn then TM it away. What about if Squirtle won and had two different charge moves? That's where you state in in-game announcements that double moved Blastoise when evolved will receive both CD moves. The newer move, of course, would be in the first slot, which is only fair, but those who really wanted both could still get both. Idk what they plan on doing in 2021 to make previous 2018 CD moves ""accessible,"" but Charizard should have just had access to both. It is a little celebration of the Charmander line, so why half bake it?

Tldr;¬†Community Days don't let Pokemon lines live up to their full potential, notably seen with the Porygon and Charmander days. Future potential CDs like Spheal do not deserve to be totally lame because the proper care isn't put into the Pokemon within the line. Extra Permanent Move additions such as with Blaziken's Blaze Kick should occur more frequently, at least to make certain CD Pokemon usable, not OP but usable. Where fit, middle evolutions deserve love as they can occasionally be more effective in PvP than their final evolutions. Finally, repeat Community Days should have both its new exclusive move and its old one available. Community Days should raise a Pokemon line up; the frustrating decisions by Niantic should not make these Community Days feel half baked.

" 

I am a F2P trainer from the beginning (July 2016) reaching Level 40 in July 2018. I have 205k catches and about 141 million XP. Bag has 3000 cap; Storage has 4000. I spend 8 hours a week on dedicated play catching and gathering resources during pandemic. My time was at least double that when I worked in an office where people left me alone. That doesn't include time of my simply opening my phone for random catches or battles or storage cleanup.

When Level 40 was the cap for Pokemon, I had 130ish maxed Pokemon. Admittedly, many of them were maxes that I would gladly take back. For example, when Lucky Pokemon were released and I got a bunch in trades, I went crazy maxing things with 80 some IV and non meta relevant. :cringe: I'd have a lot more dust if I didn't pay for dumb things like 87% Lucky Sudo, 82% Lucky Karate Machamp, 78% Lucky Slaking (when it was possible) or a 100% Armaldo.

That said, I am a firm believer in maxing Pokemon, not just partially powering to Level 30-35 or a breakpoint lower than 40 without the intention of maxing. If I can't max it for PvE, I will not keep it. After all, Pokemon GO is about that first page Top 12-Sort by Descending CP-flex! A part of me wishes I hadn't maxed out Pokemon under the old scheme, but I had my moments. I do not raid much but it was gratifying to know that I spent many a legendary raid being the one who carried the team.

Needless to say, when learning about the raising of the Pokemon level cap, I was dismayed. I spent resources on each Pokemon thinking that was the end. Now I have over 100 partially powered Pokemon. They don't automatically stink, but they all have been outclassed. They will still have use in raiding. (That is, until Niantic buffs bosses across all raid tiers and megas. I believe this is soon to come.)

My policy is that what won't make Level 50 will \*eventually\* get transferred or traded. The mons are still annoying to keep. I actually deleted some Level 40s that were traded to me that I knew I wouldn't take to 50 because of bad IV or use again. I have marked about 12 Level 40 for Lucky Trades. The ideal situation would be to find a trainer who thinks like me. For example, I had a Level 40 93 Gengar (SC/SB). I Lucky traded it with someone else's Level 40 Gengar. He got the better end of the deal at 96% while mine went down to 87%. I did not delete the Gengar because it still has functionality on my Ghost team. However, as XL candy becomes more plentiful, I will work on better IV Gengar or better Ghost attackers. I knew the Gengar that I traded away was not going to get any additional investment. If I ever built a Level 50 Ghost, that Gengar is seeing Professor Willow.

I am not yet Level 41. My XP alone could take me to about Level 48. Yes, I want to push for 50 but not at a whale pace. I honest to God just want to hoard Stardust and XL candy. I am at 1.25 million right now which isn't fantastic but workable, should I ""need"" anything. Best to save for the time when I have to max 3 mons for the Level up. Hopefully XL will be there by that time for the mons I want. (Realistically, I will have to settle for mons where I have the XL candy.) Do not expect me to participate in the GBL Master XL tier anytime soon. I think I've learned my lessons from the past that resources are precious.

But when it is time to actually power up, I will power something to 50 and it will be top IV.  Nothing will get partially powered up.  That should save me a lot of Stardust.

It is not a realistic game goal to try to out-Pokemon a P2W grinder. But I can be respectable among the P2W scrubs who only raid and don't catch and other F2P grinders. I need to know who those in Reddit land are and if you want to share strats. What are your thoughts on what I wrote? How are you going to manage your Pokemon going forward?

"Currently there are some restrictions on mass-transferring certain kind of Pok√©mon by selecting multiple mons from your storage, mythical status being one of those restrictions.

This is fine for most part, until we look at Meltan. As far as I can tell, only way to get Meltan in GO is to open mystery boxes. This means that players will encounter a few dozen Meltans at a time, or none at all. Clicking on each Meltan individually and transferring it is kinda annoying.

IMO, it would be great QoL update to make Meltan (and by extension, Melmetal) mass-ransferable. I mean, Niantic has already made a similar exception with Meltan line by making it the only mythical/legendary that can be placed in gyms.",Make Meltan transferrable by selecting,pokemongo

"I was thinking of a way to have notes in Pokemon Go. What better way to jot down some notes than to implement a notebook in the journal? You could have the original journal that had the catch and item log on one side and a notebook on the other. 

There would be two types of notes: text notes for random thoughts, and Pokemon notes. For pokemon notes, you could select a pokemon and create a note that can be easily sorted and organized in one place. The note would have an overview of the pokemon and whatever you choose to write down about it. Clicking the overview would take you to the pokemon's stat page and also have the note as a footnote at the bottom for easy referencing. Not to mention an edit button so you wouldn't have to navigate back to the notebook to make changes. There would have to be a character limit as well to prevent excessive data storage. Something like 200 characters per note. If you were to trade a pokemon with notes, the notes would be erased to prevent toxic communication between players.

 I'm sure people have been asking for something like this for a while. But I just thought I would share my idea from lunch today.

"I am a F2P suburban trainer with over 200k catches.  That number isn't all too impressive but it isn't scrub level, either.  My numbers would be a lot better if I had more time to play.  I owe it to this strat.

You will need:

1. A vehicle
2. An autocatcher (I use Ball Plus)
3. reasonable access to a large cluster of stops (for me it is a 15-20 minute ride to the nearest downtown)

Being F2P means I do not raid much, so Revives and Potions pile up.  Prior to my bag fill I deleted the following:

1. all potions
2. all revives
3. evolution items (saving some for upcoming level up task)

I also took the following actions:

1. Sent all gifts
2. Spent about 300 Rare Candy into Pokemon I eventually wanted to invest in. 
3. Dumped all berries except for Golden into gyms 

My weakness are TMs.  I still had 500 spaces filled with both Charged and Fast that I couldn't bring myself to delete or spend.  The other 200 was a combination of various evolution items, star pieces, incense and golden berries.   I had zero Pokeballs.  That put my item number around 700/3000 spaces.  

I then went to town-no pun intended.  I turn on the Ball Plus and set to spins only.  It still took me 2 hours to get my sack to full.  That included a couple gift sending breaks.  (if they had giftable, I wouldn't have had this problem).  When it was all said and done, I ended up with 1700 Pokeballs, 200 Great, and about 100 Ultra.  The rest were berries and healing items.

Hey people of reddit! I'm sure this method  have been known by several members of the community already but I just want to make a quick post to help newer / rural players but also old veteran players who may be struggling  to defeat those powerful raid bosses such as Lugia, Kyurem etc.

However, by simply exiting and rejoining the public/private lobby after a \*\*full 30 seconds\*\* after pressing the green invite button, you will be allowed to invite 5 more!!! &lt;- 

How amazing is that :D  Not only is this a wonderful game mechanic, but this also allows players to take down raid bosses at a much faster rate... which means more time to catch pokemons and more raids!!!  :D ...

"Backstory: I had two Super Rocket Radars thanks to that special event and the research task. Over the course of the weekend, I managed to beat Giovanni twice. I successfully caught both Mewtwos. Now on to the actual topic.

The question is whether I should purify one of them or not. The stats for both of them are shown below:
Mewtwo 1: CP 889, 1 star average 
Mewtwo 2: CP 934, 3 star average

Now, I know most of you are shouting ""NO!!!"" at your screens, but let me explain. I understand that there comes a buff with the Shadow effect. However, I like battling and all, but I play with the intention to fill out my Pok√©dex, not to win. So, since I have two, I figure it wouldn't hurt to purify one of them.

Also, and this could be just me, but I feel guilty when people say that under no circumstances that they will purify Mewtwo. We've all seen the show and movie, so we all know what he has been through. Not purifying him is essentially carrying on Rocket's agenda. To put it like this: Being bad makes me feel bad.

"I was thinking of a way to have notes in Pokemon Go. What better way to jot down some notes than to implement a notebook in the journal? You could have the original journal that had the catch and item log on one side and a notebook on the other. 

There would be two types of notes: text notes for random thoughts, and Pokemon notes. For pokemon notes, you could select a pokemon and create a note that can be easily sorted and organized in one place. The note would have an overview of the pokemon and whatever you choose to write down about it. Clicking the overview would take you to the pokemon's stat page and also have the note as a footnote at the bottom for easy referencing. Not to mention an edit button so you wouldn't have to navigate back to the notebook to make changes. There would have to be a character limit as well to prevent excessive data storage. Something like 200 characters per note. If you were to trade a pokemon with notes, the notes would be erased to prevent toxic communication between players.

 I'm sure people have been asking for something like this for a while. But I just thought I would share my idea from lunch today. Feel free to add or change some things because I'm sure there is a lot more that can be improved.

"Hi /r/pokemongo! 

In my free time I've been developing [Professor Oak](https://github.com/danielj0nes/Professor-Oak-Bot) - a general purpose Discord bot built with Pok√©mon GO communities in mind. 

I've already added and implemented quite a lot of features that I believe are nice to have, but I'd love to hear your say so I can implement your suggestions and further improve the bot. 

**For a little bit of information regarding the bot**:

I run a large Discord server for my city's local Pok√©mon GO community and after receiving lots of complaints from a variety of our members about the few existing bots, I've set out to improve it. 

For a preview of the features and functionality, please check out the link at the top. If you choose to add the bot to your server, you can view all of the commands using !help. The bot has been checked and approved by top.gg (the biggest discord bot platform) and you can add the bot to your server [here](https://top.gg/bot/753011266187952288).

I have also decided to make the bot totally open source (which can again be accessed by the link at the top), so that I can directly implement features or suggestions and for total transparency. You are also free to use the code to help in building your own bot, but if you would like a specific custom feature, I'd be more than happy to add it.

"Everytime PoGo releases new Legendary bosses in raids, I see the same 5 people joining the raid lobbies I'm in for one day, and then the next day there's not a single player to be seen, and it's like this for a while until the next time the developers want to add a new raid boss to the game.

I used to invite the same 5 people in my friend's list to raids but they all don't seem to play the game anymore, so I frantically invite others in my friend list who are either afk or don't want to join me in the lobby. I often spend 30 min-1 hour joining a raid lobby then backing out when the timer reaches 5 seconds, etc. and then I just give up on it entirely. 

Players in a raid lobby can click on a button that searches for and notifies nearby players who are within an appropriate distance based on what they specified in their game settings. Once the alert goes out they cannot cancel it, it functions like the raid invitations that people get from their friends. Countdown is the same, but instead of the icon being orange it can be a different color, like green or purple or something.

Players can have the option to opt in or out of receiving notifications. They can also adjust the radius distance in which they receive notifications (ex. within 500 ft of where they live, or as far as their game character can see). The people who opt in for receiving notifications have to acknowledge that their location data would be used even when the app is not open (kind of like Adventure Sync) and that they are always welcome to opt out of sending location data and receiving notifications of someone pinging nearby players.

\*\*This is just an idea I had, if you hate it like heck that's totally fine.","I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I wish there was a way to notify other nearby players in your area if you join a raid lobby and want more players (not necessarily in your friends list) to join you.",pokemongo

"I think with the introduction of shiny mew behind a real money only paywall, PoGo is not f2p anymore. 

I loved pokemon go because was F2P. I could do 95% of everything without paying any money. I have played several mobile games over the years but pogo is the only one that stuck with me since it was enjoyable even without paying.

It was good for a long time but then Niantic became greedy and the death of f2p was coming. First it was the removal of legendaries from research breakthrough. 

After that Niantic has taken a lot of anti player greedy decisions like 

Putting rare candy from 3 win to 4 in GBL

Introduced broken rent a mega system

Exclusives in 12 km egg

Level up system full of raid tasks

Expensive Elite TM system 

And on and on

The situation was becoming bad for f2p but still it was okay. But now with the ticket for shiny mew behind a not payable by pokecoin paywall the game has taken a direction of not being f2p friendly. I am sad to see a game that I really love take this direction. 

Mew is good in GBL and am extra mew will help a lot of players as they will have two for two different leagues now. 






EDIT :I am not against monetization but this is too much . I have spent all my Google play rewards money on this game.

The problem is Niantic overall is a greedy company. If they weren't doing all the greedy things already, this wouid be this bad.

Pokecoins are at half price here and India is not a rich country. The cday tickets are half price here too. 

But instead of getting this ticket at half the global price we are getting this at almost 15 dollars equivalent, which is ridiculous.

If it was 5$ equivalent here. I wouid not be calling this greedy. 5$ equivalent is much more easy to afford.) 



EDIT 2 : It might only cost similar to a movie ticket in other countries but here it's not the case. The ticket costs 1050 indian rupees. 

Even the expensive tickets at mall costs 300-500 and for local non mall movie theaters it only costs from 110-180 for a movie ticket (With Air Conditioning, non AC ones are even cheaper).

"Hello everyone,

This morning I loaded up a PGo, spun a few stops and checked my 2 challenges. One challenge was catch 10 pokemon and the other was make 5 nice throws in a row.

During the first pmon encounter I had, my first throw was a great throw and the mon escaped the ball. I seen the ticker for consecutive throws go up by one as soon as the ball hit. The second throw I made was great again and this time I caught the mon. I then noticed at the end of the ball wiggle, the catch 10 mons ticker increased and then the consecutive throw ticker would increase

I tested this until I completed one of the challenges. The same thing would happen.

If the throw was a Nice, Great, or Excellent and the mon was to break free, the throw ticker would increase immediately upon contact if it was not a catch. If it was a catch, the ticker for catching mon would increase after the ball wiggle animation and then the throw counter would increase next.

What does this mean? Catches are based off the 1st throw and the ball wiggle animation has nothing to do with if the mon will stay in. It all RNG and possibly anxiety, me personally, inducing if its a rare, shiny, or both.

1. For Psychic type attack, have L40 Shadow Mewtwo (yet to TM Psystrike/SB) and normal L35-40 Mewtwo with Psystrike, so never needed Espeon but I have never used Espeon on any Gym or Raid battles before so not sure how good it is in Raid or Gym battles.
2. For Leaf type attack, L40 Venusaur Hundo (CD move), L40 Leafeon and L40 Torterra (CD Move) mix, Evolving into Leafeon will make the other L40 Leafeon useless.
3. For Ice type attack, L40 Mamoswine and L40 Glaceon mix army, have few good IV Mamoswine to powerup to replace Glaceon in the army, so not sure if evolving into Glaceon will be a valuable add to the army.
4. For Dark type attack, L40 Darkrai army is so awesome and have few L40 Tyranitar, to replace Darkrai when necessary, so Umbreon is out of the choice.  
5. For Water type attack, L40 Gyarados (CD move) and L40 Kyogre army, so Vaporeon will be less use.
6. For Electric type attack, L40 Zekrom and L40 Raikou mix army, so Jolteon will never be used.
7. For Fire type attack, L40 Reshiram, L40 Entei, L40 Charizard (Blast burn), L40 Blaziken (BB) mix army, so Flareon is out of the choice
8. For Fairy type attack, I have both L40 Togekiss army and L40 Gardevoir army, heard Sylveon will be good but not as good as Togekiss and Gardevoir.

"Dear Niantic,

I really like tags - they are reminiscent of the MSG Pokemon boxes for you to manage your inventory.  However, one issue is favorites.  Everything that I have tagged remains favorited because of a simple thing - favorites can't be mass deleted.   

I don't think I have to explain why mass deletion was a good addition.  It's a great time saver, particularly with events happening more frequently.

However, I have to favorite my high IV unleveled Pokemon because my ""To Be Leveled"" tag doesn't protect it from being mass deleted.  This is particularly important in new events and around community days, when box space is at a premium.

Pokemon in tags can be mass deleted, which sort of ruins the purpose of the tag to begin with. So what I'm proposing is a simple ""Can't be Deleted"" checkbox in the tag menu.  The functionality is already there with Favorites, just allow other tags to borrow that functionality.  This allows you to make tags for deletion (for example, a double candy transfer event), as well as saving (PvP or PvE pokemon with good IVs that you haven't leveled up yet)

A mockup would be very simple: [Here's a quick mockup](https://imgur.com/f5wvdOJ)

Went for a walk and found that it had started working. Then I held my phone flat, lying flat on the palm of my glove and the battery saver activated. And it seemed to get worse and worse, as if it's calibration was moving in real-time, to the point where I could only get the screen to show properly if I held it perfectly upright.

I turned it off naturally and tried it again to see if it's working and now it's working perfectly the opposite to how it should. Covering the screen when the phone is flat, and when it's upright, and only ever showing the screen when I hold it upside down. Literally the opposite to what it's meant to do.

Anyone else have this issue? Hard to imagine what could be causing this, other than some error in communication with my phone's hardware. I've checked and the calibration on the phone seems fine in other tools. Seems Pokemon Go is the only app that's getting it wrong.",Battery saver sometimes working backwards?,pokemongo
"Hello - I am hoping someone may have an idea for how to get my game to work on my phone. I have an Apple iPhone 11, updated with the most current software (14.2).

About a year ago, my phone suddenly started refusing to open Pok√©mon Go. If I click on the icon, the Niantic screen will pop up but then quit within 2-3 seconds. I even got a new phone earlier this year and hoped that would fix it, and the game did work on the brand new phone, but when I reinstalled all of my personal info, the game no longer works.

I‚Äôve obviously tried deleting the game, updating it, etc etc with no change. If I log onto my account on my husband‚Äôs phone, it works perfectly fine, so I think there is something wrong with the settings with my Apple account that is preventing the game from opening.

Just wondering if anyone has had or heard of a similar issue and if there‚Äôs a way to resolve it without resetting my phone to its factory settings. It would just be a big pain to not be able to restore my photos, contacts, apps, etc. and have to redo all of that by hand. I tried to contact Niantic and Apple but they were not helpful.

It's come to my attention that I have caught as many perfect 'mons in the week from 11/30-12/6 as I have in the past 4 years all put together.  I went from averaging less than 1 per year (though I didn't play much in 2017 or 2018) to getting three in a single week.

It misses but *bounces off a table in the room*. Now she is really into it. This is the critical window when this could become an toddler obsession.

I want *her* to play so I let her throw all 30 balls in my inventory. She has fun bouncing them, then throwing them wildly off so they land in the kitchen. The last ten in a row, just wasting them into the ether. It switches to the other balls -- the good ones I saved for really rare pokemon. She wastes them all, doesn't even get him in the ball to struggle. Some of them were reasonably close enough. Some got... batted away, or blocked, or some bullshit? I'm empty.

""How do we play again?"" she asks.

""You have to go into town and get more."" I say. I think we have a pokestop by the train station.

"read a post earlier about the implementation of pokemon centers into gyms, while its a stretch i think it would also be cool to include marts at gyms as well (as they have done in the last few generations.) 

i know it sounds crazy but hear me out! with how the game has developed over the last four years the early micro-transactions have some of the most absurd pricing for their value ($8 for 200 pokeballs being the most egregious) the implementation of a pokemart could include the three basic ball types, revives, and 3 base potions (maybe max too); ya know the necessities. now these all still cost coins BUT are reduced in cost significantly. i cant imagine niantic is making huge amounts of money off these item transactions currently, most players spend money on either boxes, incubators, raid passes, or eggs/star pieces. with gifts, even rural players can get balls and im willing to bet more people use the balls given to them and the stop playing when they run out than go to the shop to purchase more.

so if a regular set of 100 pokeballs is $2, great $3, and ultra $4; niantic would make more money than on the current shop iteration and it would heavily benefit players who are limited by the items available to them! furthermore, occasionally (maybe even daily) the mart could have certain special items for a ""sale,"" maybe like 3 lucky eggs for a dollar or certain evolution items being for sale. this would cause people to check even if they are not in direct need of any basic items.

Later on I deleted the app and was done with it, and only afterwards began to treasure the sprites. Well, I put one as my steam avatar, but the rest is lost to me, and I'd really like to get them back.

I'm a pretty new player so maybe this isn't as much of an issue to veterans who don't need or care about the pokemon from them but the egg situation in PoGo is driving me crazy. The game spams so many eggs at you that it's impossible not to be constantly full, I can't imagine even the most whale-spending players running constant 9x super incubators are able to keep up with the egg spam, as soon as a slot is free the next pokestop will lob an egg at me, or the next present opened.    

It's absurd that I have no control over whether or not I want to pick these things up when there are rare eggs out there that I miss out on constantly because of all the trash ones, and my only recourse is to refuse to engage with the game, to not actually play and just walk around a bunch in order to clear some room. One mistake or forgetful moment and oops your egg storage is full again.     

This evening I went out for a run to clear a slot so I could have a chance to get an egg as a reward for getting over 50KM walked this week.

I used to rarely raid because I lived in a rural area. When I bought the bundles from the store they came with premium raid passes but they just sat in my inventory over the course of the years until I had about 70. Once I got the Pok√©mon Go Plus I realized I wanted as many red balls as possible in my inventory so it could use them to catch...  so you guessed it... I discarded about 30 premium passes to make room for red balls. You guessed it, I moved to an urban area and realized it‚Äôs never a good idea to toss premium passes.. at least not for common items.

Another ‚Äúoof‚Äù was when I used all my rare candies on blissey and slaking. I learned to just be patient and no longer use them for anything other than mythical and legendary as most Pok√©mon get events.

"The nearby feature, as it is currently, is a vast improvement over the broken garbage we had years ago. However, it's still not a finished, polished product and here's why: 

&gt; We don't have any information regarding *when* the pokemon will disappear. 

**PROBLEM**

Here's the story that prompted this: 

I *finally* saw a Noivern on my nearby that was actually a reasonable distance away. Sure, it was 15 minutes out of my way going the opposite direction to my home, but it felt worth it to me. I click the Nearby button to get a mental note of the direction/location of that pokestop.

I start the trek, and within 2 minutes it ""ran away"" and disappeared off the Nearby list. Of course, I know how broken this feature is; I know it's likely still there. This has been a broken ""feature"" of Nearby since this iteration was invented. So, I continue on my trek. Lo and behold, within 4 more minutes, it shows back up on my Nearby. 

Just as I'm rounding the final corner to the pokestop -- about 10 meters away -- it ""runs away"" again and disappears off of Nearby. ""Not to worry,"" I tell myself, ""it always does this and my very first Noivern is soon at hand!"" 

Seconds later I'm in the epicenter of the pokestop. No Noivern. Wait... did it truly disappear mere seconds before I arrived? I walk around the stop. I walk some more. It's gone. 

------

This story illustrates the broken aspect of Nearby. Back in the day when trackers were all the rage, we knew the remaining time of any pokemon. We know there's some set timer for these things. 

Had I known it would disappear 10 *seconds* before my arrival, I would've hoofed it and gotten there in time! It's was a punch-to-the-gut feeling losing out on a super rare pokemon when I tried my best to get there -- way out of my way, too. 

-----

**SOLUTION**

I doubt Niantic wants timers on pokemon, so here's what I propose:

&gt; ***Green, Yellow, and Red color Footprints.***

Green would be 15+ minutes remaining on timer

Yellow would be 5-15 minutes on timer.

Red would be less than 5 minutes on timer.


To the mods: I didn't post in DearNiantic, because there hasn't been a new thread in 6 months. 

TL;DR: I want an update to Nearby where we have Green, Yellow, and Red footprints to indicate how long a pokemon will remain, so we don't waste time walking to something that will disappear before we arrive.","Nearby feature: How it's broken, and how could be better implemented.",pokemongo

"So using just 3 Pokemon in the online battle league is similar to playing a game of rock/paper/scissors, with a few extra variations added in to the mix.

I seem to be pretty successful in the Great and Ultra League (I'm only level 37) if my first Pokemon is super effective against my opponent. In turn this forces them to either let their poke faint while I build up charge attacks, or they switch to what my Pokemon is weak against and hopefully I can counter that Pokemon by switching out. 
Also, If I can whittle down their health while my health is also low and KO their Pokemon whether I have to waste a shield or not, it gives me the advantage of them KO'ing my Pokemon on the next turn and then allowing me to send in what they are weak against. 

I have had decent success this new season using Medical, Galarian Stunfisk and Azumarill. Overall the only Pokemon I have ran into that gives me hassle is Alolan Marowak. Other than that I have won mostly 3/5, 4/5 and 5/5. 
However, when the next round comes it seems like the opponents that I face will send out a Skarmory or Alolan Marowak if I continue to use Medicham as my lead, which throws me into the switching out game and eventually losing the same way that I won previously. 

My question is, if i am successful on my last 5 battles, and i decide to continue using Medicham as my lead, does Niantic/Pokemon GO intentionally find other players that are using Hypno, Azumarill, Skarmory, Alolan Marowak etc as their lead and match me up to them next round? Or is it purely coincidental? Luck of the draw? 

I feel that they have some type of auto rotating program written in to the game that will possibly keep the Battle League a little more challenging,  but I'm not sure? That's just what it seems like.

"I've read around about evolving pok√©mon, it seems opinions differ. Maybe because some articles were old (?), I didn't actually check dates now that I think about it. Anyway, I'm a bit of a perfectionist and I don't care about ""catching them all"" or the rarest ones, at least not first priority. I enjoy finding high IV pok√©mon and collecting them, it might sound stupid but I like this kind of search. Kind of makes me an elitist too I guess (?).

I've been lucky enough to find my favourite ones with very high CP, I have four categories. The favourites (weak ones may be in this list too), the top 5 CP (with at least 40/45), the top three (with at least 42/45) and the perfect ones. I've only played yellow and a bit of silver so I'm very eager to catch pok√©mon from those gen, especially the first one! Anyway, I'm wondering when should I evolve my top 3 ones, so far I've been powering them up and I'm level 29 now and I still have a  fifth of their CP left to fill to the max (shits getting expensive). Their skills are also ideal for PVP (I absolutely love PVP too!). Pok√©mon like Koffing and Growlithe, which to be fair I don't know if they are even considered good or even viable but I like them and Growlithe is my dog who's always with me catching Pok√©mon.. He even tosses the pok√© balls back at the pok√©mon, which is odd if you ask me, as normally he'd snatch it and try and get the pok√©mon to play chase.. The freaking Lapras.. 

So yeah when is the best time to evolve a 98‚Ä∞ Koffing and Growlithe in order to get the maximum stats out of them? I also have a female Nidoran who's perfect (I really enjoyed playing with her back then), she's now around 700CP and is asking for 7k Stardust, the freaking rabid hellhound. Would you keep powering her up or would you evolve her now?

One article, the latest one I read, said that if you get a very high IV pok√©mon evolve it to the max straight away, it even had a chart that lead to that conclusion. It seems to me that if you have a very high IV pok√©mon, say the aforementioned female Nidoran, it's best to max power up her CP (at level 40 right?), evolve and then power up to the max Nidorina and then evolve again. Am I wrong to assume that?

I also have a top 3 Magikarp and I'm very eager to evolve him, he has currently around 100 CP, practically a juvenile little fishy, I was thinking of powering him up, find a freaking Ditto, and then evolve him. But again, I'm not sure if I should wait until lvl 40.

**Flower Fruits**: *Halves the damage of a super-effective move one time*

**Cactus Fruit**: *Restores a little bit of health when health gets below 25% (from quick attacks)*

**Mushroom**: *Each charged attack of one Pok√©mon gets a great boost in damage but puts some sort of ""veil"" on your team, which decreases the defence of all your pokemon*

**Tropical Shell**: *Greatly decreases a Pok√©mon's defence and puts a veil on the opposing team which slightly decreases all opposing Pok√©mon's defence*

**Tropical Flower**: *Greatly decreases a Pok√©mon's attack and puts a veil on the opposing team which slightly decreases all opposing Pok√©mon's attack*

**Small Bouquet**: *Lowers a Pok√©mon's attack. If the Pok√©mon holding this item is knocked out by an attacker, the attacker's attack is lowered*

**Pretty Leaf**: *Speeds up the cool-down time for switching Pok√©mon*

**Snowy Pinecone**: *If a Pok√©mon is hit with a super-effective move, it will also deal damage to the attacking Pok√©mon*

**Chalky Stone**: *Boosts attack stat*

**Skipping Ston**e: *Boosts defence stat*

**Beach Glass**: *Boosts HP*

**Marble**: *Leaves a Pok√©mon at 1HP after a charged move would have knocked it out (like a focus sash from the main-series games)*

**Stretchy Spring**: *Makes quick attacks slightly faster*

**Lone Earring**: *Makes super-effective moves deal more damage*

**Torn Ticket**: *Boosts a Pok√©mon's defence if it is hit with a not-very-effective charged move*",What if Pok√©mon Could Hold Souvenirs?,pokemongo

Here is an example of my conundrum... I have a snorlax that I  marked way back when as having a legacy move.

So  i  need  to  go  through  my  Pokedex  and  make  sure  my  list  of  legacy  pokemon  is  current.

I tried Go Hub but that does not list legacy moves...only ones that require TMS. I have tried googling and have visited pages of results but cannot find an up to date (ie. last 6 months) list containing the words that say legacy moves.

Can somebody please recommend a site where I can:

1.  search for a mon e.g. Snorlax
2. look at a list of moves for Snorlax and see move: LICK (legacy) for example
3. The site should list at least up to and including gen 5

"Having a playground to test throwing without wasting your precious pokeballs. 

Ideally, you could select a Pok√©mon and it will load it into the simulator, from there you can switch between different pokeballs (pokeball, great ball, ultra, premier etc.) and it will reflect the catch rate (ie. green circle, yellow etc.)

Why do I think this would be a good idea? Especially for raids where you have limited throws, you may end up wasting a few balls just trying to get used to its placement (distance) and it‚Äôs movement.

"So I don't know whether this will fit here or whether it'll be taken down, but honestly I guess I'm just hoping for a bit of emotional support.

Anyway... I live rural. I'm probably one of the luckier rural players since there's at least 2 gyms just barely on the radar from where I live, at far opposite ends from each other. A few more things that're less related to the game: I'm a late 20 year old guy living with his parents, and for years I've suffered from anxiety and depression... I'm not religious or anything, but god bless those 2 for putting up with me for so long. 

Throughout a lot of my depression, Pokemon Go has been one of the few ways for me to stay physically active and just blow off steam. Without it, I'd either (still) be a complete shut in, or... Well, you know. Depression makes you consider dark things... Even without Covid, this has probably been the worst year of my life. And to top it off, these last few weeks I've been made to feel as if I'm not even welcome in my own local village anymore, just from one (repeated) pointed question.

""Excuse me, are you using our WiFi?""

So to explain... One of those 2 gyms; the safest one I can reach without having to walk 5-10 minutes along a dangerous, busy main road, is at a pub. It's still about 5-10 minutes away but like I say, it's safer and there's actual places to sit &amp; stay out of the way. I'll admit, I hang around outside the pub a fair bit just to catch Pokemon and do the occasional raid, but to be 100% clear, no, I don't use their WiFi. As I've had to explain 3 times now, I'm perfectly happy using my own data, and I'm only there to play Pokemon.

I know I'm not doing anything wrong. It might not look the most ""normal"" to people who don't play the game, but I know that I'm well within my rights and should be allowed to enjoy the public spaces of our countryside village in peace. But the thing is, I'm not thick skinned... Although I don't let it show, I'm sensitive to this kind of stigma, and it's the kind of thing bothers me deeply. Even though I'm quiet and keep to myself, I always try to be kind and polite to others. Even if that only comes out as a somewhat awkward ""Hey there, good morning!"".

So yeah... When someone practically accuses me of doing wrong like this... It hurts. It makes me want to draw back from the world, and shut in all over again. At the very least, it makes me feel like I can't play the game...

...anway, sorry for all of that. I know Pokemon Go is ""just a game"", and not even one that's all that great (so many bugs...). But, truth be told... I kinda need it.

When releasing a new generation, they should lower the other region pokemon or something, because I've been playing for like 3 days and Kalos pokemon are almost non existent, I just managed to catch 4 Fletchlings and 10 Littleos. That's it.

The starters are nowhere to be found, I've seen one siluette of each like 34567890 KM from me for 10 min and never saw them ever again. 

I'm SICK of hatching eggs to get Whoppers and Voltorbs and crap. They should make at least 70% Kalos pokemon on eggs in this Kalos """"Celebration"""". Seriously, like 30 eggs hatched and just got 1 Fletchling, it's really annoying. Also, the catch rate on Kalos pok√©mon are super low, wtf.

"Hey trainers, this is k0ngbuster here, I'm a Level 40 Mystic Player (soon to be Level 41) :D  


I am making a post for today, for an issue that has been going on for months on end, and I can't be the only one that has experienced this.  


So, long story short, both Giovanni and Super Rocket Radars never spawn for me anymore, and I noticed this happening, specifically after Pokemon Go Fest, of this year.  


Before this, I did have Giovanni spawn twice, after getting The Super Rocket Radar, twice, I fought him, and got my Entei and Suicune from him.  From there on out, the Super Rocket Radar never spawned again, and I am left without a way to get Raikou, except trading, exclusively.  


The only things that I can realistically think of, as to why this is happening, is because a past friend of mine traded me one of her Entei.  Granted, that doesn't make sense, but here's the thing.  I wonder if because I got Entei out of sequence, and then got Entei again through defeating Giovanni, I wonder if that somehow screwed up the way in which Super Rocket Radars spawn off of leaders.  Also, I wonder if the research based Super Rocket Radars screwed my account's way of giving me Super Rocket Radars organically.  


Since this stopped working, I have defeated well more than enough Rocket Leaders (defeating each leader at least 10 times each), a combination of victories over Arlo, Sierra, and Cliff, and not even once, does the Super Rocket Radar spawn.  


Is my account possibly forever screwed?  Or have there been changes made to the game where now, Super Rocket Radars are exclusive to only long-term research?  


I have reached out to Niantic and Pokemon Go Support on Twitter, without hearing even one word back from them.  


I have tried to uninstall and reinstall Pokemon Go, including signing in and out of my account, in addition, as well as using the refresh tool that's built within the game, nothing has worked.  


I will be more than happy to answer questions about this, as there might be more to this troubleshooting that I haven't explained here.  


I would really appreciate any help on the matter, thanks, trainers!

This idea that I came up with had to deal with me wanting to become a VR game creator and very big fan of Pok√©mon at the same time now what I was thinking was if there‚Äôs a way to do this which I bet they‚Äôre really is this would be safer for Pok√©mon GO and a bigger step towards Pok√©mon in real life. What I would like to have is AR mode on mobile apps. Allow you to see the real world with the Pok√©mon on side you in the world. And VR makes you in versed in the world. If we are to Put AR mode or live tracking with VR with Pok√©mon GO compatibility people could wear VR headsets outside walking around near  traffic and be able to see them and see everything that‚Äôs going around them in the normal way it would be safer for Pok√©mon go for people to be able to do this and it would be so much more realistic while wearing the VR headset you can physically walk up to your Pok√©mon see how massive it is see how small it is and proceed to do have fun and enjoy. I didn‚Äôt know who to contact or talk to about the same deer or if there was a way that I could actually get paid if they took this idea into action because I would love to actually do this because there‚Äôs no reason it can‚Äôt be a thing and I would like to make money from it but I didn‚Äôt know who to contact so I was trying to see what the Reddit world would think my name is HYBRainz tell me what you think.",Million Dollar Idea For Pokemon/PokemonGo,pokemongo

"So I live in a pretty rural area and at the end of my street there is a gym. It is reachable from my house and it is the only gym within a good 15 minute walk radius. As someone who works a lot from home I don‚Äôt get much time to go out walking to battle other gyms so usually I like to just have one of my Pok√©mon sat in the gym outside my house to earn some coins 

However about 2 weeks ago I noticed the same slacking always taking over the gym and then camping in there. I would knock it out and it would seem like within 5 mins it would knock my Pok√©mon out and sit back in there again

There are a few other yellow team members around so I‚Äôm usually not the only one in there but he will easily wipe up to 5/6 Pok√©mon out of the gym. 

His slacking is 3900+ CP and in the last week it seems like no matter when I take the gym or how many times I take it back off him he will always take me out again. He must have an infinite stock of revives and potions too to continually heal this same slacking.

I‚Äôve tried waiting until right before I go to bed so that hopefully I would not get knocked out until the next morning but I‚Äôd awaken to find I‚Äôve early a single pokecoin and once again the same slacking is sitting there smuggly. 

It‚Äôs not even that hard to knock him back out again but he must have an alert on his phone to tell him when he‚Äôs knocked out so he can immediately take it back, no matter what time of day it is

Really sucks because it makes it way harder for me to earn any coins and I don‚Äôt get the raid bonus because the gym is usually his colour

Hopefully he will get bored eventually",Trainer in my local area and his god damn slacking!!!,pokemongo

"Quick back story! I've been playing the game since its release years ago and for the past two years I've been blessed with living next to a gym. I got a decent sized valor flag on my porch.
 When i first started with the gym i typically only got my coins and then just stayed off, it was a pretty popular gym when the game was released.
 But a couple months into this year i noticed someone had copied my username and was on blue ( I am Valor). They stopped by multiple times a day and we fought back and forth for months. But because i live close and if i hadn't had all my coins yet (my Pok√©mon would only be up for about 20 minutes at a time till they knocked them off) i would continue to knock them off. After about three months of back and forth they now added another copycat.  For instance, i have the number 2 after my username, they used 1, and 3.
I shrugged it off because i still have the upper hand. not only am i a higher level then all of their accounts. I also live right next to the gym and knock them off because they're using my username.
However, today something changed. I was interrupted by a note of my door, it said:
Dear Hazorb2,
Listen here you level 40 sweat, stop taking over the gym. I don't have any coins, and you always kick me out before i get my 50. We challenge you to a battle. If you want things to get spicy, let's wager some Pok√©mon. If not i get it, you're scared of a level 30.
yours truly
(their original username which i wont use), Hazorb3

Now part of me thinks this is funny, and i think i was challenged to a gym battle in good fun. But the other part of me has a bad feeling, not only have they tried to copy my username, they've now stepped onto my property. They left no way for me to respond other then to put a note back onto my porch, and idk if i want to interact.
Part of me thinks they should just join Valor with me and we can both bask in the coins together and they can stop whining. Or they can stay blue and continue to feel my wrath because that's the game.",Did I just get challenged to a Pokemon battle by a stranger?,pokemongo

With the addition of the tagging feature and the fact that you can now mass select any Pokemon, I think it would be useful to add some extra functionality to the tags beyond the organizing.

The two main options that I was thinking of were to add the Favorite function to any tag, to prevent accidental transfers and also to stop mass selecting Pokemon that just can't be mass transfer anyway (like shinys), and the ability to lock Pokemons with certain tags to prevent accidental powerups or second move purchases.

Obviously, it would be better to have all those options separated each with its own activation, but for the sake of simplicity I just ended up diving them into two main groups.",[Idea] Add functionality to the tagging system with preventing transfer and lock options,pokemongo

"Medals have been and continue to be one of the most undercooked parts of this game.  They feel like an afterthought.  And that‚Äôs a shame, because they could be a really cool feature.  But they are unevenly grindy - some more than others - and hardly rewarding.  Some reward you by unlocking the ability to buy certain cosmetic items, but that‚Äôs hardly a great reward.

At a minimum, rewards and medal goals need to be rethought.  Having to catch 2500 Dragon types is a much stiffer challenge than 2500 Normal types.  These numbers should be reworked to be more proportional - something like 4000 Normal types and 1500 Dragon types.

Unique challenges like catching small Rattata or XL Magikarp are *extremely* unrealistic and grindy.  The original maximum goal for Rattata was 300 XS ones, and I just finished that last month.  And I have been playing for longer than 4 years.  There is no way I am going to catch the necessary 700 more.  It‚Äôs just unrealistic.

But it‚Äôs also unrewarding.  At the very least, Platinum medals should reward something *meaningful*.  An XP reward would be great, or a choice between a bundle of Lucky Eggs or Starpieces.  Heck, implement something like a free Pok√©mon bag upgrade with each Platinum medal we unlock - this would actually be a reward that would feel worth the grind!

"Hi everyone,

So title pretty much. I've been level40 for 3 years now, and shortly after John Hancke said they were planning on rasing the level cap, I started grinding XP, and when it officialy came out, I already had the necessary XP to get to level50 (sitting at 182M atm).  

I strongly disagree on how they implemented the Go Beyond regarding the fact of being able to power up your pokemons until level 50, but since the MSG has 100 levels and in Go we raise 0.5 levels per power up, I'm okaish with this, but  IMO there should be better rewards for hitting level 50, which don't break the game (the powering up kinda does it). 

&amp;#x200B;

My suggestions (not saying to implement all, but maybe one/two of them)

&amp;#x200B;

* 2nd infinite incubator: You will be able to hatch more pokemons but since the odds of a good one are very low, you'll still need to buy incubators if you want to grind for good pokemon in eggs.
* A small discount on powering up pokemon, let's say 10%, like if all your pokemon had been purified.
* Better chance of getting a shiny. Again, very low % increase, but enough to motivate shiny hunters to grind until level50

I'm definetely going to grind until level50 , but I'd like more benefits than clothing and avatars. What do you think?",Better rewards for reaching level 50?,pokemongo

 To obtain it in the main line series, Eevee must know at least one fairy-type move and have a high friendship level with you.

Don't you think for all of that hard work I should at least get a lucky egg, maybe another egg incubator (honestly walking 5- 12km to hatch an egg is whack), or possibly a lure?

"I'm seeing a lot of people asking ""can I make it to 40 in time?"" around here. Just a few weeks ago, I was also one of those people. I was only lv 35 (\~6.6 mil total xp) as of November 20, and was seriously doubting that I could reach lv 40 by the end of the year. I decided to try anyway, and as I did, I learned a lot of things that could be useful to others who are also on the grind. As of December 3, I'm currently 1/2 way through lv 38 (13,651,379xp), so I'm on pace to hit my goal even though many people told me it was impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

**Just to start with, please above all else stay safe. There's a global pandemic going on and as much as we all love this game, it isn't worth risking the health of yourself or others if you are unable to play safely. Please follow your local health guidelines and wear a mask. Also, for those of us who live in colder areas, be sure to stay warm. :)**

&amp;#x200B;

Now on to the tips I have to share:  


**1) Quantify Your Goal**

Do the math. Hitting level 40 requires a total of 20 million xp. Take a look at how much you still need, how many days you have, and figure out how much you need to average per day to accomplish that goal. Once you have that daily quota, decide if you think that is feasible for you. If so, you can use it to motivate yourself. Try to not give up for the day until you hit at least that amount, and if you feel up to it, surpass that goal as often as possible to make things easier for your future self.

**2a) Mass Evolving**

With the recent xp rebalance, evolving a pokemon is now worth 1,000xp. That means it can be quite lucrative to stockpile pokemon and then evolve them all at once with a lucky egg active. Pidgey, Weedle, Whismur, and other pokemon that cost 12 candy to evolve are ideal, but every evolution is worth the same amount of xp. With a lucky egg going, you'll get 2,000xp every time you evolve something. You'd be surprised how much xp you can earn in half an hour this way. I typically spend most of my time grinding catching pokemon, then at the end of the day, (sometimes more or less often depending on how many pokemon I've got sitting around waiting to evolve) I pop a lucky egg, evolve as many as I can, then go home and clean my storage to prepare for tomorrow. If you do this, it's VERY important that you make sure to save enough pokemon for...

**2b) December 29****^(th)** **Spotlight Hour**

During this event (6^(pm) to 7^(pm) local time), you'll earn double xp for evolutions, which stacks with lucky eggs. That's 4,000xp per evolution for a whole hour. Stock up on pokemon to evolve beforehand so that you can squeeze every drop of value out of this hour as possible. Don't bother with evolutions that lead to new dex entries during the spotlight hour, since the new entry xp won't be quadrupled. Time spent on the animation of a pokemon being added to your dex is better spent evolving something else. With 2 evolutions per minute, you'll earn 480,000xp over the course of the hour. If you can manage 3/min, then you'll get a whopping 720,000xp.

**3) Friends**

As of a few days ago, it's too late to get to ultra or best friend with anybody who isn't already on your friends list with some degree of progress already made. It is not, however, too late to earn a massive amount of xp from friends. There are various sites, discord groups, and subreddits with people looking to exchange friend codes, utilize those to expand your friends list. Getting a friend to good friend status only takes one interaction and is worth 3,000xp (6,000xp with a lucky egg), and getting to great friend takes 7 days and is worth an additional 10,000 (20,000 with an egg). You're going to be limited to sending 100 gifts per day, but that's a LOT of potential for xp. Also keep in mind that just sending a gift is worth 200xp by itself. If you add 100 new friends, and send them all gifts every day for 7 days (assuming they open those gifts), you'll earn 1,440,000xp without even using a lucky egg. After getting them all to great friend, it's your choice if you want to keep them around, or delete them and add a new batch of 100 and try to get them to great friend as well.

**4) Raids**

Your daily free raid pass is valuable, don't waste it. The best use for it is hosting a legendary raid for remote players. Just like exchanging friend codes, there are sites, discord groups, and subreddits where people go to join/host remote raids. Hosting a raid means you'll be locating a gym with the raid you want to host, friending 5 other people, joining the raid, and then inviting them to join you via remote raid passes. A legendary raid awards you with 10,000xp for completing it. Even better, doing a raid with friends increases your friendship level, so those 5 random people you invited will all immediately reach good friend status, giving you 3,000xp each. That, plus the 10k you got from the raid itself, adds up to a potential 25,000xp per raid (not to mention giving you an encounter with the raid boss).  Now just because you get one raid pass each day, that doesn't mean you necessarily have to do a raid every day.  You can leave your pass in your bag, then the next day you can use the pass you have, get your new pass for the day, and then immediately use that pass as well. This strategy is particularly effective if you find a place with multiple gyms with legendary raids active, since you might be able to activate a lucky egg and then host 2 back-to-back raids before it expires. If you pull that off, that's 100,000xp and 2 legendary encounters. The easiest way to make that happen is to play during the weekly raid hour, which takes place from 6^(pm) to 7^(pm) local time on Wednesdays.

**5) Throws**

Curveballs are hard to master, but if you can get to the point where you reliably throw them, then you earn an extra 40xp per catch. That doesn't sound like much, but over the course of thousands of catches, it adds up. That said, don't waste time with curveballs if they're causing you to miss throws you otherwise could've hit and you don't feel like you could get the hang of them relatively quickly.

The other type of throw that you should be thinking about is an excellent. Excellent throws recently got increased 10x to be worth 1,000xp now, doubled to 2,000xp thanks to the event. That's MASSIVE amounts of xp to be earned from a single catch. Now, not every pokemon is equal when it comes to landing an excellent. Some are pretty easy, while others are nearly impossible. Learn which ones you have an easier time landing an excellent on, and which ones you should just stick to great throws with. Keep in mind, it's always a gamble to go for an excellent, since you're risking the 200xp you could've got for a great throw in exchange for the chance to instead get 2,000xp. If you can get to the point where that gamble pays off more than 10% of the time, then it's worth it, otherwise just go for the great throw.

**6) Daily Coins**

You need to try your absolute best to get your 50 coins every single day. Find gyms and get yourself in there. You get 1 coin for every 10 minutes spent defending a gym, so you need a total of just over 8 hours of defense per day to get the 50 coin max. That time doesn't need to be consecutive, nor does it need to be earned by a single pokemon. The best strategy is to grab a spot in a gym in the evening/night when people are less likely to be playing. A great way to earn the full 50 is to get 2 defenders into gyms at 8^(pm), then if they can hang in there until at least a little after midnight, they'll get you your 50 coins before you even wake up. Every 500 coins you get is 8 more lucky eggs. Be careful of gyms that might be too remote though, as you only earn the coins after the pokemon is knocked out. If you've got a defender sitting in a gym for a week, you'll still only get 50 coins when it gets knocked out, and those 50 will count towards the daily limit for the day it was defeated, not the day it was put into the gym.

**7) Lucky Eggs**

 The value of a lucky egg is directly tied to what you do while it's active. Don't waste an egg if you aren't going to be earning a lot of xp in the next 30 minutes. But also don't confuse ""earning a lot of xp"" with ""doing a lot of things"". For example, let's say you activate a lucky egg, and over the next 30 minutes, you catch 50 pokemon, all with great throws and all on the first try. Each of your 50 catches was worth 500xp, so in total, the 50 of them are worth 25,000xp. Using a lucky egg there would double that to 50,000, meaning the egg provided you with an additional 25,000xp. By comparison, if you activated a lucky egg just before reaching best friend status with one of your friends, you'd double the 100,000xp that gives you, meaning that even if you immediately closed the game and wasted the remaining 29 minutes and change left on your egg, that egg would still be worth 4x as much as the previous example. Not every egg can be **that** valuable, but just think carefully about the raw amount of xp you'll be earning when you decide when and where to use your eggs. Decide how many eggs you have/can afford, and what's the minimum value you're comfortable getting out of them.

**8) Devices**

If you have a go plus, pokeball plus, gotcha, etc... make sure to use it effectively. That means if you're evolving, raiding, sending/receiving gifts, etc... you should have it catching and spinning stops in the background. If you're manually catching, have it spin stops for you in the meantime. This is especially true for when you have a lucky egg active, since by completing two xp-earning tasks at once, you're getting even more value out of the egg. If you have an auto catcher going during an evolution spree for example, that adds a huge amount of xp.

**9) Feeding Gym Defenders**

Another source of xp that's often overlooked is the xp you get when feeding a berry to a pokemon defending an allied gym. The xp rebalance made it so that every single berry you feed to a gym defender gives you 50xp. You can feed each pokemon up to 10 berries before it becomes full. If a gym is maxed out with 6 defenders and you've got enough berries to feed all of them, that's 3,000xp. A drop in the bucket compared to other methods, but if you're like me and often find yourself needing to make space in your bag, berries are often the first thing you get rid of to make room. Better to turn each berry into 50xp than to just throw it away. Also keep in mind that if you've got a pokemon defending a gym, you can use it to inspect the gym remotely, which allows you to feed the defenders regardless of how far away you happen to be. That means you can use your berries to feed defenders while you're at home, so you can spend all your time out going for the more rewarding xp sources.

**10) Making the Most of Purchases**

If you choose to spend money on the game, you should at least make your dollar go as far as it can. Be honest with yourself about how much money you think you're going to end up spending, and then rather than buying a small amount of coins here and there, buy them all at once to maximize the bulk purchase bonus. Be on the lookout for any discounts or promos on Google Play or Apple gift cards that may be out there. Also, if you're on Android, make sure to sign up for Google Play Points (not an advertisement). You earn play points every time you make a purchase on the play store, as well as from various offers such as installing featured apps (for those, you can click install and then immediately cancel the download. You were given the points the moment you clicked install.) Those points can be redeemed for $3 coupons for pokemon go. You can only have 1 coupon at a time, but if you've got enough points to buy more, you can get a new one as soon as you use the one that you have. Every coupon you get allows you to grab 550 pokecoin package which normally costs $5 for $2.

1. Everyone is running the same or similar meta and it‚Äôs so annoying (Azumarill, Whiscash/Stunfisk, Marowak). It sucks when you have really good 3 or 4 star pokemon that aren‚Äôt part of that meta that end up being absolutely useless in battles. How do you deal with metas that arise like this every season. Remember the little cup when most used Bronzor and Mincinno, battles got so agitating and frustrating. It takes away the fun in battling and completely takes away creativity in battles. 

2. My god the pok√©mon encounters for winning 3 battles is atrocious. It‚Äôs already a pain in the ass to get 3 wins especially considering I don‚Äôt have azumarill so I can‚Äôt even be part of the meta.

It would help people who live in cities and rural areas and save them time from clicking from raids to raids. And then missing the raids cause they are checking the ones no is in at.

I live in a city where not many people play but there are still a decent amount of players. People do do raids here but i just never get in lobbies where there are enough people to do the raids. It would also help the people who are on on Wednesdays for increased raids but because there arnt a whole lot of people i dont know when or where they will do the raids.

"Hi there! I wanted to share an event that happened to me today that I'm not sure is a glitch or not. 

I was super exited for the season celebration event that was starting today, so I was checked the app periodically since I was unable to travel for most of the day. One of these checks resulted in a treeko spawning next to me, that upon inspection was regular. After a raid and a rank up to 30, I checked (what appeared to be) the same treeko again, deciding to catch it, but this time it was shiny! I didn't pay close attention to the CP, but I think they were different. I caught the treeko and closed the app, very happy and not too concerned with the rather strange encounter. 

Later, I opened the game again with the intention to get a walk in since I finally had the chance. Upon opening the app, another treeko spawned in a different location, and upon inspection it was shiny! This time I was rather concerned, given the first encounter was suspicious enough and that a second made it even worse. I completed my walk, checking all spawns that I found (none of which were treeko or shiny). 

I have opened and closed the app multiple times, and both treeko are still shiny. Is this the work of a glitch? Or one of my luckiest moments ever playing Pok√©mon? If something similar has happened that you know of, please let me know, thank you!",Suspect Shiny Treeko Encounters,pokemongo

"Since people seem to be confused how tags work/how to edit and delete them, here's a short guide.

Within your normal Pokemon list you can find a new ""tag"" option in the top left of your menu. There you can create tags with the plus symbole in the bottom left corner. There you can select a name and a color for each individual tag.

Once a tag is created you can assign pokemon to tags either by first klicking the created tag and then selecting pokemon, or by selecting pokemon normally (just like how mass selecting and releasing/transfering pokemon works) and then selecting a created tag via the tag option above the usual transfer option.

So now you've created a tag and assined pokemon to those tags. But how do you change/edit name or color of your tags, you may ask.
Select ""Tags"" in the top left corner to see all tags you've created. There ypu can select the tag ypu want to edit. Once selected you'll see a list of all pokemon that have that specific tag assined to them. There you can uncheck pokemon to remove the tag, thus removing them from the tag list.

\-I have some nice Pok√©mon that have non stabbed attack, should I always aim for stabbed attack for my best Pok√©mon? For example, I have ancient power on Rayquaza, so if I choose to change it, can I choose which attack he will get or is it random ?

\-For Pok√©mon with two type, should I use the same type twice or mix it ?

Completing my GBL sets earlier i ran into a player who I belive dodged me. The match screen froze with both of our characters standing there for a solid 30+ seconds, then the match beginning noise sounded. 

As soon as the next screen came up it showed the ""Time's Up!"" notification and faded to black. After a moment it showed the background of what is typically the ""good effort""/""you win"" screen but my character never materialized. 

After this, it went back to the typical world screen but would continuously revert back to the blank background screen. Restarting the app did nothing, a full reinstall was the only fix. This dodge bug has been a known issue for months now, and as far as I know this is an even worse version of it (normally you just can't enter Go Battle League).

This is the second time I've had to reinstall the app in 2 days from being dodged. If you're not aware, when you do so you have to redo all your settings and remake all your battle parties.

"  So I was minding my business staying in my car with my gf hitting any gym we could while in the car due to the outbreak rising here. It was around 7pm, already dark and cold.
  
   Anyway a raid is about to start in 15m so we decide to take the gym over for the ball bonus. We noticed every time we get the 6 pokes down to 1/3 of health, they would get Razzed. So we decided to do the good ole go on in one at a time strat we came up with [she goes in while I wait at attack acreen, as soon as she defeats the first mon she backs out, I jump in, then she gets ready to battle as soon as i defeat.] 

  We were able to take down the first 2 mons within 5 m of him trying to razz, but we chained em down too quickly. So he gave up feeding the rest and we took it over and dropped some pokes in before the raid. Right as the raid is starting we see a Suv literally fly up onto us where we were parked like 2 feet from our bumper. Dude had his window dowm and was just screaming something, idk if it was the same dude defending the gym but we took off. He followed staying on our ass &amp; I could see him cursing in the rearview window, my lady is having an anxiety attack at this time so I floor it &amp; drive to the police station that is 10m away, he zooms off as soon as we pulled in.

So next time you send that player a gift instead of sending a standard sticker, you send them a sticker saying, Sorry No Passes, or I Missed Your Invite Send More. So they know not to waste an invite for a while, or it was a mistake but you would like them to continue to send you invites. Get you some remote passes and been out of the loop for a while?

"Hi all,

Late to learning how to fast catch here. I've watched a few videos and I get the principle - hold berry/pokemon menu, slide over, throw ball, run. But I've only gotten it to work about 2 times out of trying it 30ish times. I'm running into one of a few problems:

1) When I throw the ball, it just snaps to my other finger that's holding the menu and spins

2) The berry menu opens during the throw

3) I can't grab the ball at all (multi-touch issue?)  


I'm playing on a samsung A20, so definitely not the height of mobile gaming tech. Is this a problem with my phone or something I'm doing wrong with the method?

Also, more general question, but I suppose the idea with fast catch is that you just restart the encounter if you didn't catch it? I guess that's still faster than watching the ball break animation. 

Thanks!",Trying to learn fast catch but can't get it - what am I missing?,pokemongo

For anyone that doesnt know for every excellent throw you gain about 2300 xp for every excellent catch.

I just hit level 39 so 5 million xp seemed out of reach in a month but not anymore.

Take advantage of the double xp evolution spotlight hours everyone! Evolving a pokemon used to be 500xp, it has been double to 1000xp right now and with the spotlight hour of doubling againg that makes it 2000xp then add a lucky egg to make 4000xp for every evolution!

I made about 546,000xp in 1 hour for evolving during the double xp evolution spotlight hour. Thats insane!  I hope this helps any trainers out there who wish to hit the level 40 goal before december 31st.

"I just got back into the game this week after over 4 years and a lot has changed. I've done a fair amount of research to get myself caught up, but I'm still having some trouble deciding which Pokemon I should invest my startdust into powering up. I was at level 23 when I stopped and have gotten myself to 28 in the past week. 

My wife's cousins that got me back into the game are much higher level and raiding with them has gotten me 2 Azelf, a Charizard, a Houndoom, and a Blastoise. We were visiting them for Thanksgiving (they live 6 hrs away from us) and that made it easier to do multiple raids together. Now that we're back home, the number of raids we can do remotely are more limited.

My primary goal right now is to collect legendaries from raids and build up teams to help take them down more easily. I'm also trying to build up a good collection of counters for the Team Rocket bosses and taking down gyms. We have 3 accounts in our house now at levels 28, 26, and 20. If we can get to a point where we can take down level 5 raids with just these 3 that would be great, but I'm assuming that's not enough even at much higher levels. 

The highest CP Pokemon I have are a 2500 Gardevoir, \~2000 Snorlax/Machamp/Gyarados/Aerodactyl, Charizard at 1800 (levelled up a few times), and the two Azelfs around 1800. It seems to get any of these to my current max level would take a crazy amount of stardust (\~150k+). I have 265k at the moment so that's only enough to invest in one. 

I know Shadow Pokemon get a 20% attack boost for raids and PVP. For someone in my situation, would I be better of keeping them as Shadow and powering them up or purifying them and then powering up for reduced stardust cost. Top candidates here are a 2\* Electabuzz, 3\* Machop, and 0\* Bulbasaur. I have higher IV and level versions of all of these Pokemon as well that I could spend the candies/startdust on. I have a 2000 CP Machamp (3\*) and two 1100 CP Venasaurs (0\*) already.

I'm working my way through the Team Rocket battles to get to Giovanni and then get a Shadow Mewtwo. It seems like he is definitely worth the stardust investment while keeping him as shadow version. After that I'm not sure who to invest startdust into or if I should just save until I get something worth the investment.

"\*Disclaimer\* Before anyone flames me or just overreacts to this post, just know I have been playing pogo since day 1 but I am more of a casual player than competetive-  so I don't really know what's meta and stuff. But recently I've been doing a bit more pvp and raids to help collect some of the legendaries.  My recent get of a shadow Mewtwo at 10/12/15, and a bit of research has brought me to this question. 

When researching if I should purify my Mewtwo I became a bit confused why every site/ opinion said to leave it shadow. If I have the facts correct I understand that it gets a 1.2 times attack boost from the shadow bonus, but it also gets a .83 times defense reduction from the shadow bonus. And after battling with my Mewtwo a bit, that offensive boost doesn't seem so great when my opponent is doing so much damage to me. So I'm wondering if the whole keep it shadow theory is not exactly the right move. Please explain or give me some insight if I'm wrong here:

If I purify my Mewtwo, he will go to at worst a 12/14/15, be less expensive to power up, and I won't have to spend 120,000 stardust and 120 candy on adding a second move so I can teach him Psystrike since you can't change frustration (I guess you could call it 100,000 and 100 since it cost 20k and 20c to purify). He will lose the 1.2 times boost, but also lose the .83 times defense. It seems to me that losing the attack bonus, and in turn also losing the extra damage taken, while adding in better his stats it actually makes more sense to purify him. Not to mention all the resources I'll save.

I would love to hear some opinions on this.",Are Shadow Pokemon really Better than the purified version??,pokemongo

"Hey guys, seen a lot of people looking for ways to get lots of XP to hit level 40 before the end of the year and wanted to share this tip. (Apologies if you already know this but someone might find it handy). 

Go through all your Pokemon and any that you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll need the candy for for pvp or raids mark down as ‚Äòev‚Äô. Stuff like whismur and caterpie and the likes. 

Each spotlight hour has added bonus‚Äô and usually once a month there‚Äôll be one with double evolve xp. There are two of these this month, one today/tomorrow depending where you are and another on the 29th. 

Each evolve is usually 500xp, doubled at the moment due to this end of year event, then doubled again through spotlight hour and if you double again with a luck egg you can grab 4,000xp per evolve. You can get through 100-150 evolves in an hour depending how quick you are. That‚Äôs why you mark them down as ‚Äòev‚Äô so you can find them all with one search (quicker) and no other Pokemon start with those letters (clearer).

"So- I have this non - visible task, I.e. not in any of my field research/special research areas stating : catch 200 Pokemon.... the rest is not visible in that stupid bar that briefly floats into ones way- and there are a LOT of those bars lately.   I just noticed this one Tonight and as far as I can tell from poking around Reddit it‚Äôs 200 in one day.

Hopefully someone can confirm that. 

Now here‚Äôs my real issue: I opened the game at 1830 (630) EST today. Does that mean I have until 1630 EST Tomorrow? Or will it reset at my time midnight? Or worse yet- is it on a non local time a‚Äôla wizards unite - who randomly assign times in different time zones to mess with their small band of progressively more annoyed players? 

I can probably do 200- but I don‚Äôt want to start now only to have it reset at my midnight, or your midnight.

If anyone has some wisdom on this it‚Äôs much appreciated.

Further- do you all think the swarm of bizarre medals will be part of buffing up those poor unfortunate souls who are between level 37 and 40? I feel as if they are being unnecessarily punished- my best friend did the math to figure out how many points, and how many hours she‚Äôd need to play- she‚Äôs a tic away from 38- and it was staggering.

"Hi guys,

I'm wondering how/when exactly you unlock the various Special Research tasks?
(The ones on the far right side, when clicking the binoculars icon).

I've searched online, but although there are many guides that show which tasks you'll encounter, it doesn't really say what exactly triggers that quest in the first place?

For example, for the A Ripple in Time (Celebi quest), it says that it's unlocked after completing part 3 of A Mythical Discovery.

However, I'm now part way through part 6 of A Mythical Discovery, yet still have yet to come across A Ripple in Time.

I've also found there's supposed to be several global Special Research tasks available, yet the only one I have there currently is A Mythical Discovery.

Just wondering if I've missed the end date for some of them? 
Or if I'm missing something?

Im still attacking like normal, but the opponent isn't taking any damage ( all with the best signal i can get which almost always will let me play no problem). Then all of a sudden they use like 100 quick moves it seems like( as all the hits are stacking basically) and i shit you not. I had a full hp mon out( typing was neutral) and the person murdered me as like a charge move, but it was using bite like it was a supped up hyper beam. All the hits hit me consecutively, and super fast to were it litterally melted the hp bar. And I had that happen not even 15 minutes ago from the time of this post.

The only issue I can think of is if they make the rates to high then already increased shiny rates (like community days) would be even more ridiculous. I suppose though the two solutions to this would be to have this increase be void during community days or again just have it as a tiny increase.

There is already something similar in the main series games even with something called a shiny charm that vastly increases shiny odds. You usually get this from completing the pokedex.

"Level 40+ is live, cool! This includes the new XL candy system, which is... super arbitrary. A flat 100 normal-to-XL rate for all Pok√©mon does not seem sustainable or fair.

Drops from wild spawns are scarce as far as I can tell, and other mechanics (trading and transferring) are RNG at best.

What I do not understand is the (lack of) thought process. A blanket conversion rate does not make sense in light of recent updates like Mega Energy gained from walking with a Buddy. Rattata XL candy conversion should not be the same as Mewtwo. A simple solution would be having the conversion tied to Buddy Distance.

My formula would be (number of kilometers per candy)*5 = normal candy per XL candy. Legendaries would remain at 100 normal candy per 1 XL candy, whereas Pok√©mon like Rattata would be 5 normal candy per 1 XL candy. I do not see how this would be detrimental since we would still need Rare Candy and Raiding for the most powerful Pok√©mon. 

I am not using the XL candy system unless it becomes totally apparent that it will not change, at which point I do not know if I will continue this game. For people who are doing the system and would feel ‚Äúcheated,‚Äù my solution for Niantic would be a bundle with some large amount of Rare Candies or XL Rare Candies.

"[Pok√©mon Go Kanto Collection](https://imgur.com/gallery/6fbsPzA)

I've always been a big fan of the Kanto (gen1) Pok√©mon. With level 50 here, I wanted to document my collection(s) as they are now.

**Completed**
* Full Kanto Pok√©dex (151/151)  
* Male and female Kanto Pok√©dex (132/132)  
* Lucky Kanto Pok√©dex (150/150)  

**In Progress**
* 77% - Fully power up one Pok√©mon (level 40 currently) in each Kanto evolution line (62/81)  
* 37% - Get a shiny &amp; lucky Pok√©mon in each Kanto evolution line (30/81)  
* 22% - Get a shiny &amp; lucky &amp; L40 Pok√©mon in each Kanto evolution line (18/81)  
* 11% - Become best buddies with a Pok√©mon in each Kanto evolution line (9/81)  

I haven't decided if I will try to take Pok√©mon of each evolution to L50. That sounds super painful at the moment, so we'll see.

While documenting these collections, I am getting really excited for custom tagging. It would be awesome if, at some point in time, they made it so you could share certain tagged collections with friends.

I've included some bonus screenshots in the album. Thanks for reading!","With level 50 here, I wanted to document my current Kanto collection. Thought I'd share!",pokemongo

"Dear Niantic,

My family began playing Pok√©mon GO this year just before the pandemic began.  We greatly enjoyed learning how to play the game and discovering new Pok√©mon for the first time.  My children love Pok√©mon, and I thought this would be something wholesome we could share.  For a time, it was that.    We eventually found an online community and learned how to raid with others.  We got better at figuring out the mechanics of the game and learning what to look for when catching a  Pok√©mon (e.g. hundos, PvP stats, etc.).  It was as we began to delve into PvP that I made a frustrating discovery:  many of the best moves for a number of important Pok√©mon were unavailable to us.

It did not take too long to discover that these were Community Day moves.  I started working on figuring out how we could get them.  I considered trying to trade for the  Pok√©mon we needed, but given how the stats reroll, that did not seem like a great option.  People in the community advised me to wait for December to obtain them anyway, as there would be a December Community Day that would allow me to evolve  Pok√©mon and get their CD moves.

So, I followed their advice.   We went around collecting the best possible versions of each CD  Pok√©mon we could find and collecting as much candy as we possibly could.  It was frustrating to wait and regret every Pok√©mon that we evolved early on before we knew about this, but it seemed like the best way to handle missing so many different CD moves.

Now, it would appear that none of the 2018 CD moves will be available to us despite our patience.  This seems incredibly unfair to newer players, as there is no way to compensate for the time when we were not playing the game.  

My question to you is this:  Do you actually want newer players in the game?  Do you want new participants for the GBL?  We are both of those things, but I begin to think that we are perhaps not the target audience for Pok√©mon GO.  We have invested time and some money to try and catch up, but if this is going to be impossible for us, then I think it may be time for us to let it go.

I do not know what is planned for 2021, but I cannot feel optimistic about how I might go about getting these moves in the future.  I will not pay for Elite TMs (and I could not possibly buy enough anyway) to try and get these moves.  I'm frustrated, and I don't see why I would not want to give up at this point.  I write this because I suspect that I am far from the only one.  Plenty of people have been saving Pok√©mon all year for this one chance, and now that seems to be rendered null and void.

I am finding myself increasingly unable to overlook the opacity and lack of communication on Niantic's part.  Even to me, a newer player, it is clear that efforts are being made to monetize every aspect of the game to an increasing extent.  Some of the previous decisions that were made seemed to dismiss the pandemic.  Others were incredibly frustrating to a large proportion of the player base.  The glitches in the GBL persist.  However, for me, this is the most frustrating decision of all.  I cannot ignore it, and I cannot fix it.   

Niantic, please reconsider this and include the 2018 CD moves in the December event.  Even if other opportunities for these moves may be coming in 2021, they have not existed all year.  There is no communication about what those opportunities might look like, and given how all of this is playing out, the trust that is needed for someone to wait patiently for months to get these moves no longer exists.  I already did that, and it did not work out so well.",An Open Letter to Niantic,pokemongo

"I was waiting for this December desperately. I was collecting good PokeÃÅmon, I was battling with Team Go Rocket in order to get rare shadows, and I hoped that I will meet the new year with a good army. Not as good as people who play since 2016 have, but good enough to compete in some way.

Today Niantic has informed us about the December event, and it is a very frustration news. We can get CD moves only from last two years events. Well, this means Salamance with Outrage, Blaziken with Blast Burn, Hydro Cannon for Swampert and Empoleon as well as Rock Wrecker for Rhyperior. And that‚Äôs it.

The last time I could get a Frenzy Plant Venusaur, a Meteor Mash Metagross, a Blast Burn Charizard and a Last Resort Umbreon was in December 2019.

Also, I had a hope to remove Frustration from my shadow ‚Äômons, especially Mudkip. Bummer. This means, I will get an army of shadow Swampert not earlier than in a year.

"For the past week I have been gathering mega energy for two species simultaneously. One via buddy walking, another via mega evolution (beedrill).

Gathering mega energy via buddy is pretty straight forward. Just walk, and when you get a candy, you‚Äôll get mega energy as well.

Mega energy from the mega evolved buddy is harder to understand. I started by figuring out I had already hit the 2000 candy cap for beedrill, so I evolved it. Later on I saw that I was already at 2000 candy again, so I evolved another.

Initially I thought it was just from quests, but I started following it closely and I wasn‚Äôt doing that many quests that award beedrill mega energy for it to fill up that easily. Then I started looking at the mega energy I had after each Pok√©mon of the same type I caught (poison, bug) and I actually saw the mega energy increase after some of those catches.

I don‚Äôt quite understand the mechanic, but the true is that I have been mega evolving beedrills with a nearly permanent mega evolution in place all the time, and I keep hitting the cap, sometimes a couple of hours after the mega evolution, sometimes near the end of the mega evolution time.

Niantic just states we get extra candy from Pok√©mon with the same typing as the mega evolved Pok√©mon. Doesn‚Äôt seem to point out that having a mega evolved Pok√©mon awards energy at all.

"Last couple of weeks I've been returning to the game a step at the time. I used to hunt, trade and battle every day before pvp went out. That made me win gym battles more than 30 thousand battles in a little over 18 months. I got bored of the game because of spoofers and not having a car so... A year later, I do have a car and I can get easily to some gyms and walk over a lot of different parks in a single day.

However, I've noticed that the number of multi accounting in this game has sky rocketed to the point that there are people with 6 accounts of the same color that removes you from the gym with a seventh+ account and then put their 6 accounts there, making it impossible to people like me to grind for the gold medal in other way than to make raids at the gym.

As far as I remember niantic was taking actions against multi, what happened? Are they focusing in the money earned by the cheaters more than its own rules? (niantic clearly states that spoofing, multi and sharing are not permitted).

Before you say the most obvious statement, I've seen these people with 2 and even 4 mobiles. Probably all xiaomis due to their capacity for splitting screen.

Question.. it seems silly to assign a legacy medal to players who have gotten 40 by dec 31st. Personally, I know four players that have ""hacked"" and paid for play/level up in 8 months.. What about players that have been with you day on/day off since 2016? What about players that have ground (?) In game for a couple years but not employed the ""in game hack"" of friend xp? How is catching thousands of Pokemon not equal to three ""best friends."" There are tens of thousands of players that are between level 35-40 (and others) that love and play this game each day. Yet you choose to give a legacy medal to those that are level 40 come dec 31st? Do you know (you do) how many players pay to win/level up in this game? Do you know how many don't, but actually enjoy each programmer choice from the challenges to community days?

"Hey everyone, just had a question for you.  To give context: I had to put my Silkie hen down a couple weeks ago when her health deteriorated rapidly from Marek's Disease out if the blue, and I decided to try PoGo in my Shiny Hunting effort to capture a Shiny Female Torchic.

The Problem: I live in a rural town where you'd need to drive to find a sidewalk.  Not only that, but the weather's getting colder, I work, and of course, the lovely pandemic is still a thing.  However, I've since learned that the mall I work at is an amazing spawning ground for Pokemon, as well as other city-like areas.  Now I don't know if seasonal changes are a thing in the game, but I hardly see any Fire Types, and thanks to the Lake Trio event, I'm only getting Psychic Pokemon with incense.  Other times I see fighting types (Machop mostly), Surskit, Magikarp, Psyduck, Goldeen...hardly anything else.  But the mall seems to hide a wide variety of Pokemon and a few PokeStops and a gym.

So now the question is, what kinds of areas hide Fire Pokemon?  I've found very few in between (Charmander, Sun-Castform, Tepig, and Vulpix), and I never see them again.  And if seasonal changes do affect the game...guess I'm looking at Cryogonal for a while (probably isn't in the game, but you get the joke).",Best places to find Fire Pokemon?,pokemongo

You know that situation:  
You walk 12 km to hatch an egg from the GO Rocket Boss and hope for a shiny Deino or something good. The egg hatches and all you get is another Trubbish.

Do you know the Rates for specific Pokemon to hatch?  
Oh well, TSR tries to tell us the Rates, but it costs much effort and a lot of time.  
Time is what we don't have in an just one Week Event.  
So what is the solution to this?

I can tell you: Niantic should show us the rates for the hatches!  
In some Countrys it's illegal to offer Lootboxes in Videogames and i think this is the biggest point in all of this.  
The Eggs in Pokemon GO are like Lootboxes for a long time now.  
You remember that Event where shiny Deino was released and noone seemed to get one? After the Lootbox thing was brought to the table, Niantic did an ajustment to the rate for Deino.  
But how many players did already buy incubators and hatch worthless eggs?

To prevent this in future Events and change Pokemon GO to the better:

Niantic, tell us the rates of the egg hatches!!

"Im not saying it needs a complete makeover but the overworld could be a little bit more interesting (since you spend so much time looking at it) instead of just a simple grid pattern with a few different shades of green. I'm thinking like an occasional tree, bush, rock, etc. just to make it feel a little bit more alive. It would change according to season, so now with Halloween everything gets kind of a spooky vibe. Again, nothing overly substantial probably since it needs to be clean enough for visual clarity and not be a memory hog (could be a toggable setting I guess).   


Maybe some objects could even be interactable in some way. Like tip over a rock and you can find some semi-rare bug Pok√©mon you wouldn't normally find. For Halloween there could be jack-o-lanterns which would give you rare candy (y'know, trick or treat) with a daily limitation.

"If someone has already posted this or given a better or more accurate description of how this works I would love to know.

I was interested in how max cp is calculated, based on the appraisal ratings. I had a bunch of Magmars left over from the community day so decided to see if I could predict the cps for these Pok√©mon at a given level, based on these ratings.

It was a bit of a process but long story short I came up with the following, somewhat reliable method (for my magmars at least) of doing this. The values for Attack, Defense and HP are out of 15, the approval rating. The base CP is the CP for a Pok√©mon at a given level, if it had the worst appraisal rating possible.

Max CP = Base CP + 8.70*Attack + 5.75*Defense + 5.38*HP

As I did this in about an hour with very little testing and a lot of trial and error, these values are bound to be slightly wrong. Does anyone know if this is how it works, and if so if the coefficients change depending on the level and type of Pok√©mon, or how it is actually calculated?

"In my small town of around 5k population, we have around 10 gyms. There is a man, lets name him C. He has 6 instinct accounts and 2 mystic accounts. he keeps the main section of town solidly instinct, and the rest with his last 2 mystic. With me being team valor, I have no hope of getting coins unless I attack Mr C.

If he is awake he will golden razz his pokemon every time for hours until you either give up, or he goes to sleep. Mr C has seemingly an unlimited amount of golden razzberries and he is active on average from around 10am to 2am. If you do end up catching him when him isn't paying attention, it will be taken over, most of the time, before you get more than a few coins. The only option for local players is to take a gym either before he is active or after.

I for the fun of it decided a few months back to try and bleed his golden razz berries. So 4-5 days a week I will spend 1-3 hours attacking his gyms only to let up with spinning pokestops or catching a few pokemon.
95% of the time I do not take the gym. 

He usually only heals when the pokemon are at 1/3 hp, but I noticed that if I leave the gym at 2/3 hp then leave it for 15 min. it will bug him enough to golden razz them anyways. So I started a new strategy. i would attack a gym once, then immediately go to another gym. rinse and repeate. 

Yesterday was one of my few successes. I started at 10 pm, and followed my previous strat. Each and every time the gym was fully healed after I left it. I continued to bleed his golden razz berries until he finally went to bed at 2am. 

So I'm pretty proud of myself for finally getting a full 50 coins and for bleeding an absurd amount of golden razz berries!",Me vs Multiple Account Gym Defender,pokemongo

It has been two hours.

"Greetings!

I started playing the game about six months to a year after it debuted.  At first, I played by myself, and that was enough for me as catching and evolving was a big challenge as PGo was my very first Pokemon game.

As I did not have decades of exposure to the game, the absence of an encyclopedic recall of what types are good counters and which are weak to others really held me back in the early Gym model and in Raids.

However, on one early morning walk I passed by someone who was also playing and they asked me if I was on the Discord.  Huh? Didn't know about it, but joining that group was really what kept me playing the game after I had already put it down because with no one else playing and I could rarely Raid successfully.

At first, the group was great, but as time went on, it started to become clear that some or all of the moderators were being very hard on anyone raising criticism about the game's mechanics, especially the increasing monetization of events and the still unforgivable scarceness of so many new mons.

I'd spoken with other members about this conversational intolerance, and I found out that I wasn't the only one who was told that they should consider quitting the game because they had issues with the way it was being changed.  Most telling was that one of the moderators apparently has a friend at Niantic who is in a position of some importance.

So, after a second, brief exchange with one of the mods on Wednesday, I left the server.  Later that day, I texted one of the founding members who told me that he had been pushed to give up his control over the group because he'd been inactive for awhile, and once that happened, his moderator abilities were revoked.

I'm more than a little sad to not be participating in the same way, seeing what people are catching and planning Raid trains, but I gotta admit, it feels better than remaining mute while a not-so-silent partner to the corporation exerts autocratic levels of control over what should be an open discussion forum.

I'll still play the game and I've only lost two Friends (so far), but it's a really gross situation.  I'm hoping that when we're all able to go out and play alongside each other again that I can still interact with most of these people without it being weird.

I know this kind of crap happens often in fandom, but I've rarely experienced it myself.

"So, I was scrolling through Instagram and I noticed the new post by the PoGo account. It‚Äôs a teaser for the surprise 1 star Pok√©mon ([This](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIJFygHFpMA/?igshid=453anrostdx0) is the teaser)After watching I can safely say that Espurr is the only Pok√©mon it can be.

Here is my proof:
At the start, where the video flashes, the purple background with emanating waves appears. This background is for psychic types. There is a unique background for all types, for those who didn‚Äôt know, and these backgrounds appear behind your Pok√©mon when you tap on them in the Pok√©mon menu. The background corresponds to their first typing. Now, we know the surprise Pok√©mon is definitely a Gen 6 (Kalos) Pok√©mon, so we need to look at Pok√©mon which have psychic as their first/only typing. One singular Pok√©mon fits that category, Espurr. Furthermore, dataminers have leaked some of the models that are in the game‚Äôs code, and Espurr is one of them. 

And with that I conclude my reasoning for why Espurr is the surprise Pok√©mon.

"After the Giratina event and Swords of Justice event, I became very close to the local community of Pokemon Go players in town. Through this, I recently learned gym courtesy and became a lot more aware of how long people have been in gyms before I kick them out to ensure they get daily coins. For context, I have only begun playing in March of this year as a suggestion from my dad to entertain myself when walking home from work. I would always kick out the only gym in my path, but now I check everyone‚Äôs time defending there and take detours accordingly.  

However, in my town, there is this notorious group of five players, who I will call The Men (they all have themed names that end in ‚Äòman‚Äô) that are team Valor and take all gyms at night. They always put in low CP Pok√©mon that are able to stay overnight and claim all the fifty coins. In recent months, I believe they became more aware of my playing habits of always fighting gyms at 9pm and would kick me out about 20 minutes after I get my pok√©mon in a gym. Which is fine, respectable. Got to get on that coin grind, I guess. 

But The Men are notorious for another reason. Every PoGo player in town despises them because they are rude in multiple ways. Besides immediately kicking out newly placed gyms, they would all back out of a raid if someone that was not one of them came in (which unfortunately, my dad and i experienced first hand in a Mega Venusaur raid). Through my local players, I had also learned that The Men are just one man playing on five separate accounts. A lot less respectable in my books, since he was using sheer numbers to deny everyone who isn‚Äôt valor their daily coins. 

Today did it for me. On my daily walk home at 9pm, I kicked out two mystic gyms: one that everyone was in for 11 hours, and another that was only one who had 30 minutes (but i saw they had another gym, so I hoped that they could get coins from there). I took two in anticipation of the wrath of The Men, and alas I was right to do so. When I got online at 12pm, I saw I had been kicked out of both. Unfortunate, but I tried my best to get some overnight coins. However, upon closer inspection, I saw one of the ones he kicked me out of was left team-less. When I noticed this, I was infuriated because I would keep him in a single gym up to this point when I‚Äôd battle, but he greedily took all the gyms in the area (5-10 gyms) to deny me and my fellow players opportunities to get coins. I was sure that this was intentionally to spite me, since every other gym in the path was plagued red, but the gym I have the most amount of time in was a pristine, mocking white. 

Luckily, my dad recognised my frustration and drove me a quick 2 minute drive (since it was late) to drop off a Pok√©mon again. It was a tiny victory, but I am still happy he will wake up tomorrow morning to see my Empoleon reigning over our gym proudly. 

TLDR; some jerk in town who plays on 5 accounts I‚Äôve been struggling with for months kicked me out of a gym and left it team-less, but I was able to quickly sneak back in to claim overnight coins. I hope he will learn some manners soon and play the game with everyone else!",My struggle with 5 players and Gyms,pokemongo

1. +5% attack
2. +5% defense
3. +5% hp
4. 4 additional power ups (max level 52)
5. +10% attack (total 15% bonus)
6. Moves of this type always have STAB

8. 10% bonus to all stats (25% total)
9. 6 additional power ups (level 55)
10. 2 Megas of this type can be evolved at one time

"Recently I discovered r/pokemongofriends and, with the current Lake Trio raids, learned the full potential of remote raid passes.

"Hi, I recently started playing pok√©mon go. I'm enjoying it but I think my dog isn't.. None of my friends play it and any information I find is from the Internet, however some things I haven't figured out yet.

When I see pok√©mon on the map, some of them have a light blue/white spinning effect around them, what is that aura?

How futile is to wait to find the perfect IV pok√©mon? I live by the beach in CA and I find a lot of Magikarps, like shit loads, so I thought great opportunity to catch a perfect one. It's been about 3-4 days now and the highest I've gotten is 98% (43/45), I'm in no rush to get a Gyarados but I'd like to get one soon enough. Shall I give it a couple of days to search a bit more or evolve this one?

Related to the above, how detrimental is each of the star points. Like are your pok√©mon all perfect or are you happy with a 94% Abra for example?

Say you have a perfect Seadra that you caught, and you also have a 97% Horsea. Is it best to power up and evolve the Hornsea, due to higher CP, or it doesn't matter? What I mean is it worth powering up already evolved pok√©mon that you've caught or is it best to wait to find a great unevolved pok√©mon to power up and evolve? 

Some websites say, for example Koffing's ideal attacks are Infestation and Sludge. Infestation though is Grass and I thought I should be aiming for same type attacks as the pok√©mon. So why are they saying Infestation is ideal for Koffing?

"I am a relatively new player. Downloaded the game when it launched, but deleted it after a few months because it was boring. Earlier this year I heard about events and raids and PvP so I decided to downloaded it again in March 2020. My stardust is very limited. I‚Äôve been Powering up 100% Pok√©mon as well as PvP ones. So far I only have one team for the catch cup. A mediocre Crobat (went with it because the 3rd move only costed 10k stardust. A rank 16 Wigglytuff and a Rank 1 Electivire. I had to spend all the dust I gathered from both Community days and poured it on those 3 which happened to be my best Pok√©mon. Well,  Spotlight hour was 3 days ago. I didn‚Äôt get a good one because it was weather boosted where I live. Not even a 90% one. That‚Äôs not all. All I see are perfect counters to my team. Alolan Sandslash, Whiscash, Galarian stunfisk. What I do is cycle my leads. One lead is Crobat, another one is electivire. But what I noticed is that when I lead electivire, I mostly see Whiscash leads, and when I swap into Crobat I mostly see Skarmory (which electivire beats), Alolan Sandslash and Galarian stunfisk. This cup only benefits the players that have the stardust reserves. Me who has not been playing as long, have to stick with lose sets. This whole week has been

Tuesday 2-0, 1-0, 3-0, 0-0, 3-0

Wednesday 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, 2-0, 3-0

Thursday 0-0, 3-0, 2-0, 1-0, 2-0

Today 0-0, 1-0, 3-0, 2-0, 0-0

34 wins. 66 losses. 


It‚Äôs not like I can swap my team, I don‚Äôt have the stardust to spend nor good enough Pok√©mon to Power up. 

There‚Äôs 2 more days of this dreadful cup and all I‚Äôve gotten are a few mediocre Pok√©mon encounters not even a legendary and a lot of stress. I can usually cope whenever I lose in a game, but I hate how the game says ‚Äúgood effort‚Äù like I didn‚Äôt even try. I really hope Niantic never brings this cup back. I liked the little and Kanto Cup. I didn‚Äôt feel as restricted because for the little cup. A third move was not as impactful since even resisted moves would do a good chunk of damage, and for the Kanto cup, I already had a good selection of Pok√©mon to begin with which gave me a ton of wins and even got a Virizion encounter. The catch cup is really stressing me out and just want it to go already.",The catch cup is garbage.,pokemongo

"First and foremost I would like to thank everyone who read my article. All the suggestions I wrote down came to my mind during my active 5-month playing time and some of them were derived from other games. I don't know how this community will react to my suggestions. I also don't expect Niantic to respond to any of my suggestions. And if they do, we as a community will always get something out of it.  

QOL suggestion:  

Gradual permanent increase of experience points and stardust you get.

for example:  

* Level 1 - 10: 0 % bonus
* Level 11 - 20: 10 % Bonus
* Level 21 - 30: 20 % Bonus
* Level 31 - 40: 30 % Bonus
* Level 41 - 45: 40 % Bonus
* Level 46 - 50: 50 % Bonus  


Raids:  

The first person to enter a raid should be chosen as the raid master. This should result in the fact that there is no timer in the raid lobby, but the raid master can only press start when at least 5 people have set their status to ""ready"".  

Contradiction: What if I do not want to make a raid with five people?  

Answer:

* Level 1 Raid: Recommended players Number 1, optionally expandable lobby size
* Level 2/3 Raid: Recommended number of players n, optionally expandable lobby size
* Level 4/5 Raid: Recommended number of players at least 5, optionally expandable lobby size.  

&amp;#x200B;

Benefit?  

Answer:  

I have been playing the game since July and one thing was noticeable on Reddit, Whatsapp, Telegram or similar platforms about raids. 120 seconds are not enough to organize and execute a raid. I also see threads from time to time where players complain that players jump off at the last second. Therefore these QoL suggestions would have a positive influence on the gaming experience.  

The intentional or unintentional leaving of a raid should trigger a timer. No matter if it was because of the internet connection or because you find yourself funny.

How can this timer look like? Very simple, it should hurt if it is triggered too often!  

Penalty levels would be a solution:

* Penalty level 1: 30 minutes
* Penalty level 2: 2 hours
* Penalty level 3: 24 hours
* Penalty level 4: 1 week  

Every single negative behavior should increase the penalty level by 1. One week of clean play reduces the cooldown of an account by one. An account whose cooldown has been reduced to level 2 by clean play would receive a level 3 cooldown (24 hours) the next time it violated.  

The daily raidpass should be a long distance raidpass at least until June 2021. We have two players in our raid-whatsapp group with limited access to the outside world. As an example, parks are closed in which arenas are and cannot be reached. It would at least be a helpful bonus in the current event until June 2021.  

Catch Pokemon:  

At level 40, players should receive a belt. Players can fill this belt with a certain number of a berry variety. These berries are to be used automatically when catching a Pokemon. A toggle button would be helpful here in the raid lobby. For Niantic to get something out of it, it should be possible to extend this belt. Say 200 coins for example for 5 more berry places in the belt.",QOL suggestion,pokemongo

"I started playing this game 18 months back. Before the whole work from home scenario, I used to get a lot of coins from gyms. The main reason was train commute. Since most of the railway stations were gyms, all I needed to do was wait for instinct gyms and put my mons in it.  

However during lockdown, my movement was mostly limited and I started to spend whenever needed. I have around 15 gyms visible from my home. On rare occasions when I get to visit any of them, I try to put my mons in it. However, I started noticing a strange pattern over the months.

Whenever I put a Pok√©mon in a gym, this person (let‚Äôs call him Mr. Spoofer) takes it down within 2 minutes. All 15 gyms I can see from my home have his Pok√©mon at all times. I tried all the gyms from morning 6 to night 8 over the last 8 months. Everyday it‚Äôs the same story. 2 minutes and the gym turns back to red from yellow.

The funny thing is there are very few active players in my area. Mostly the guy gets coins because I knock down his gyms. Otherwise they stay there for more than a week before someone takes it down.

Sometimes when I do raids, I get there five minutes earlier, so that he won‚Äôt be able to take my Pok√©mon down as the raid would start.

During the go fest I decided to drive a bit so I I could get spawns from gyms. I was also hitting the gyms that day. I hit around 10 gyms that day. But the trail of red never left me. As soon as I hit one gym, and moved on to the next, the last one had changed colours. After noticing this, I just left the last few gyms without placing my pokemons just to give him a little bit of hard time.

After this incident, I had stopped hitting gyms altogether. Few months back I had managed to level 40.

The wayfarer community thought me about the s2 cells and using that I got 10 new stops nominated around my area. Three of those stops are accessible from my home.

This week one of them turned into a gym. I was so happy and put my Pok√©mon in it. As usual Mr spoofer, seeing yellow came to attack. This time I could fight back.

It made me so happy to give him back what he did to me for so many days, from the comfort of my home. I kept feeding golden berries to my Blissey, to make him hit the gym again and again. Finally he gave up.

Now even though there is red all around me, the yellow near my home shines bright, and I‚Äôm so happy about it.",Me vs Mr Spoofer,pokemongo

"So after my 13/13/15 Snorlax running lick with superpower and body slam kept losing in mirror matches in the Catch Cup, I almost lost my mind. I mean, I probably would have if not for the almighty PVPoke gods who came to my glorious rescue and cleared things up. As a side note, I just discovered this site a week ago, and so only recently have crawled out into the light after living in a dark cave for the entirety of my PokemonGo existence. Screw all of you for not telling me sooner...you will PAY FOR IT after I memorize all of PVPoke and beat you in the Go Battle League (I say that with love :) )

Ok on with it, already. Jeez...if anyone actually gets far enough to read my question, it will be a goddamn miracle. Here it is: When running battles on PVPoke, I learned that out of two Snorlaxes running identical movesets, the one with 5/13/15 IVs will beat the one (MY ONE) with 13/13/15 IVs. Holy hell. In that moment, my world and everything I've ever trusted to be true BURNT TO THE GROUND while Niantic laughed from the sky. Now, like a drug addict who's hit rock bottom, I have to start over and build anew. You know what else I have to do? Put my head on my pillow at night knowing I threw away all my snorlax candy on what I thought was the best one I ever caught. 

If someone here could please help me understand IVs and how exactly they work, well you'd be a savior. Here are my specific questions:

1. Does anyone actually know how IVs work? I mean, they seem super freaking complicated.
2. Do lower IVs come into play during other scenarios? So non mirror matches but otherwise close matchups?
3. Are 3 star and hundos worth more than bragging rights? When, if ever, are they helpful in PVP battles?
4. Are IVs a case-by-case situation? And if so, how should we think about evaluating our IVs when deciding which mons to keep in the Pokedex and which ones to transfer over to good 'ol Professor Willow?

Hello everyone. I am a level 37 trainer who has been playing off and on since the game came out.

"I‚Äôve been playing Pok√©mon go for a little over a year now and it‚Äôs always been a goal of mine to reach level 40, and now with the year coming to an end I wanted to challenge myself like I‚Äôve never been challenged before. I stopped playing Pok√©mon go almost entirely recently due to covid and school but when I opened the app again yesterday I saw that any players who reached level 40 before the end of the year would get a special reward, so I knew that if I wanted to do it I had to start right away. So here‚Äôs the hard part, with about 36 days until the end of the year if I didn‚Äôt start right away it would be impossible to make it. After doing the math I realized that if I were able to get 140k  per day for the next 36 days, I‚Äôd be able to scrape past level 40. Now it‚Äôs time for the strategy, my plan is to put my friend code on every single friend code sharing website and page all over the internet, because when you become good friends with someone you gain 3k experience, if I do this every day along with raid days and grind harder than I‚Äôve ever grinded during the December community day, I think it‚Äôs possible

"Just an update on my journery from Level 33 to Legacy 40. I made it to Level 35 yesterday and then took it easy.

Today, I went a little harder and, with some well timed Lucky Egg/Friend combos, I managed to gain almost 800k XP.

I'm now starting to stack up Ultra Friends to eventually pair with some Lucky Eggs that I'll no doubt have to choose over Remote Raid Passes.

I still have just under 13 Million XP to grab but I'm hopeful. I've managed to grind almost 3 Million over the last week and that number will only sky rocket when the Ultra Friends start rolling in.

I'll definitely hit 36 before December but I want to be comfortably close to 37 if not **at** 37. That would put my mind at ease a bit more.

" Howdy Trainers,

Trying to figure out if you have what it takes to earn the Legacy Level 40 medal? Check out the [Road to Legacy Level 40 Medal Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WhsQdfbJ0riCnpHGoPc9xUJgVX3d81prxZOuMnsFzEQ/edit?usp=sharing) (you will want to save your own copy to use your own values).

This is a tool I created for myself to see how many daily friend interactions I would need to reach level 40 by December 31st. I ended up going a bit further with it though. The main thing to know about using this is that you put **your information** in the **green** boxes and the expected xp gains will calculate in the **blue** boxes. Fill out the 'Trainer Daily Training Plan' based on what you will do each day and as long as your 'Remaining XP per Day' is negative you are on track to get the Medal!

Two things I learned while making this:

1. For those trying to reach level 40: Far and away the most significant thing you can do to gain XP is progress your friendships everyday. If you want to see the math behind this check out the Friends tab of the calculator.
2. Be conscientious of your Lucky Egg use. I've read a lot online about using lucky eggs for raids, along side mass evolving low candy pokemon, or for your 7 day catch/spin streaks. These alone are all pretty terrible wastes of a lucky egg if you have a limited supply. To show you what I mean, here is an example

* Person A: Catches 90 weedle with pinaps, gets 720 candy to evolve 60 weedle, which is about the max for a 30 min Lucky Egg. Evolving 60 weedle gets you 30k xp, which is 60k with a Lucky Egg, and we will be generous and say it is a 2x XP event, for a grand total of **120k xp gained** for 30 mins of straight evolving.
* Person B: Waits until 2 friends are 1 day away from Ultra Friendship, with would amount in 100k xp, but is **200k xp gained** for opening two gifts.  

   * Main point here is, when you are thinking about using a Lucky Egg, consider the opportunity cost of not having it later. Yeah, **100k xp** for the 5 raids you can get to in 30 min during raid hour is nice, but sacrificing the egg that could turn the last gift you need to become best friends from 100k to **200k** isn't.

TL;DR I built a tool to help you determine if you are on track for the Legacy Level 40 medal. Also learned that friendship is the key to prosperity (in Pokemon Go at least)",Road to Legacy Level 40 Medal Calculator,pokemongo
"I hate the hoops you have to jump through to get red 12km eggs. You need to time when hatch an egg to when you earn a rocket radar. Which means when I'm walking through downtown, I have to keep a very close eye on exactly when my next egg will hatch. 

But the eggs will hatch a little bit before the hatching animation happens. Which means sometimes I'll spin a pokestop and replace that hatched egg before I even realize it's hatched. 

And now I need to hatch another egg before I battle one of the Rocket Leaders to get the 12 km egg.

I don't know if this is intended play or not. Either way, it sucks. Stop it. 

I understand that the obvious solution (letting us delete eggs whenever we want) is something you won't do. I'm not entirely sure why, but I'm guessing it's to prevent farming of some kind. So let's give the idea a reasonable limit: let us delete one egg per day. 

It's not really spamable. And it gives us the ability to make space for the more valuable eggs for which we work hard.  I usually only hatch 1-2 eggs per day. Please give us this quality of life change.",Let us remove one egg per day,pokemongo

"I had this thought, and wondered what others thought about it. 

One of the hallmarks of the original Pokemon games was the requirement to challenge the 8 gym leaders to earn their badges, and then finally, to defeat the Elite 4. I mean, that was like the entire story line of the games. I thought about that a lot when I first started playing Pokemon Go, but it hit me again recently.

I was thinking it would be cool if local gyms were taken over periodically by the 8 gym leaders from the games, maybe starting with the leaders from Red, Blue, and Yellow, (Brock, Misty, Lt Surge, Erika, etc.) and rotating the leaders from later generations later. (Not sure how Giovanni would fit in).

The feature could function something like a Rocket stop, or more like a raid, where it comes and goes randomly, but players could challenge all 8 leaders who are using their signature Pok√©mon and type specialty (grass, fire, electric, etc.) This could be tied in to research lines or tasks as well, with rewards for catching stronger Pok√©mon upon defeating the gym leader. For example, maybe you could catch a Vileplume after defeating Erika. Then, after beating all 8 gym leaders, you could have a chance at battling the elite 4, similar to battling Giovanni after defeating the three Rocket leaders and collecting radars/ components.

A few other ideas to make things more interesting:

You would have to defeat the Gym Leader using only Pokemon whose type are weak to the Leader's strength. For example, if battling Erika's grass type, you could only use ground or water types.

The gyms could be set to be defeated in a particular order (or not).

Caps could be put on the CP of Pok√©mon that trainers use to defeat various leaders as well. For example, when defeating Brock, you could only use Pokemon with CP under 1000. This could change per Leader or be constant across all Gym Leaders.

"Hello  
I play GO since it's release and sadly had to restart at the beginning of December 2019 cus a bug locked me out of my main acc (so F in chat boys, level 39 gone).  
I worked back my levels and even during a pandemic (I live in Italy) somehow I got back to Lv. 34 rn.  
So the reason of this post originally is to ask you guys: What would you love to see Niantic do to help those who are not allowed/have restricted movements in their country/region/town?  
Personally I do have some pokestops near, so  ain't too much a issue, gyms eh, lightly away but since I now can move, is better and can reach them.  
However what I couldn't do, is to get many pok√®mons that would help in the missions, or see my friends to trade ect, so maybe implement the ""distance trade"" to even say ""keep social distancing"" would be good, as well with the battles.  
I read before a post about trading and battling with bots, wich I find good too.  
Also a HUGE question cus I was a bit out of the loop for a bit, so I might missed that,  but what about Pok√© maps? or like live maps showing where the pokemon are live? are those considered cheating?  
If it is I kinda do see why but at the same time I don't, since Niantic could release a own map app or program to show you where  they are, since you STILL HAVE TO WAL, have to link your account to it so anyone who would try to exploit with gps faking would be caught easier.  
TBH somethin like that would help me to find an aerodactyl for the mission since I indeed missed my chances during may-june since we where in full lockdown and barely could move out of home (and knew I had a nest not too far from home but unreachable with any method.  
And honestly, on my own opinion, they could put a way for people who have pokestops around 100-200 mt away to reach it, specially if their country is in lockdown.  
I am sorry if I put something maybe controversial in here but I wanted just to hear your ideas, nothin more.

"I've been playing on and off since launch in 2016 with some long stretches off (up to about a year at one point.) With the upcoming changes I was aiming to get to Level 40 by the end of the year but it ended up being much sooner then expected thanks to the power of friendship XP. I wanted to share this moment with the community as none of my close friends/family are into Pok√©mon Go. 

[The moment I got to Level 40](http://imgur.com/gallery/gMt916d)

If you are reasonably within reach of Level 40, keep grinding friendship! I don't really have anything to say that hasn't been said before, but maybe I can motivate a few others in a similar position.

I work full-time and only have a handful of gyms/stops around where I live/work, so being able to earn XP without having to walk or block out chunks of time for play was essential. 

I primarily used pogotrainer.club to find new friends (protip: anytime you update your account settings you get bumped to the top of the Worldwide list and plenty of people will add you right away). I also tried to earn some coins for Lucky Eggs so I could time Great Friends (3 hearts) and above with egg use. 

Also, don't underestimate the huge impact that simply becoming Good Friends can have. Just 10 new Good Friends a day can mean 210,000 XP in a week with no Lucky Eggs needed. Add a new friend, open the gift they send (or send your own), remove the friend if you have limited spots, rinse and repeat.

"Hey everyone,

I've been playing this game religiously since July 2016, and have just reached level 40 after hardcore grinding night and day for the past few months. I currently live in the suburbs where it's a bit more challenging to play this game than other places around the world -- and I'm just looking for a place to vent a little. 

I think it's completely ridiculous that getting to Level 50 requires over 175 MILLION XP. Unless you're a dedicated Pok√©-Tuber or millionaire with all the time in the world at your fingertips then this will most likely be impossible for most players. And to top things off, the research tasks for each new level aren't even fun. They're stressful, hard, and overall very frustrating to see. Seeing tasks like ""30 raids"" or ""defeat 50 team rocket leaders"" or ""hatch 30 eggs"" on top of millions of XP is just a big ""F U"" in my eyes. I'm not trying to say that things should be handed over on a silver platter, but I just wish things weren't also excruciatingly hard... if that makes any sense lol. 

I guess one could argue that I don't have to try to get to level 50 if I think it's too hard, which is true, but I think the system should be more fair to all players to have a chance of reaching it. 

Additionally, with Gen. 6 on the horizon, I think it's absurd how they handled the roll-out of Gen. 4 &amp; 5. The game used to be about catching Pok√©mon and adding them to the dex. Gens 1-3 were so much fun because the game had an emphasis on catching Pok√©mon. Not locking them behind raids, eggs (12km eggs...really?) and other paywalls. There's still a bunch of Gen. 5 Pok√©mon they need to release as well as mythicals from Gen. 4 and Kecleon! Don't get me wrong, I'm excited for Gen. 6 but they need to get their releases in order. Sheesh. 

Anyway, I hope this post doesn't upset anybody, that is not my intention. As a long-time player, I needed to let off some steam about a game that I absolutely love. I just wish the game went back to it's roots a bit and focused more on what it was originally about: catching Pok√©mon.

TL/DR: I miss the old objective of the game which was catching Pok√©mon. And I think that the new XP requirements &amp; research tasks for Levels 41-50 are positively unfair and absurd.

## **Introduction**

With the 2020 holiday shopping season about to head into its peak and the big [Go Beyond](https://www.pokemongolive.com/post/gobeyond-2020/) update coming to Pokemon Go, I thought it might be a good idea to share what I've learned from phone shopping this year. Additionally, the latest [0.193 update officially ends support for iOS 11 and Android 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/jyp1mu/psa_the_update_that_is_rolling_out_now_01930_is/), so there may be people looking for replacement phones. 


This post was inspired by a couple of great submissions made in [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/6708ee/phone_buying_guide_for_pokemon_go/) and [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/8bc18g/android_phone_buying_guide_for_pokemon_go_2018/). I am not the original author of those posts, nor am I particularly well-versed on the latest tech, but I'll try my best here. Also, full disclosure: I have not played around with any of these devices, and everything discussed here comes from viewing phone specs, ""professional"" review articles/videos, and my own personal interpretations. 

Here's how the post is organized: 

 * **tl;dr** (too long; didn't read) - up at the top
 * **Introduction** - you're here
 * **Considerations for Playing Pokemon Go** - I describe the main metrics I'll use to compare phones and give an example based on personal experience
 * **Phone Makers &amp; Highlighted Models** - The bulk of the post, where I talk about phone brands and point out notable models, usually a high-end flagship and a mid-tier option. 
 * **Conclusions** - closing thoughts
 * **Glossary** - A few phone tech terms that might be helpful to readers

All prices listed in this post are the base model starting retail prices in the indicated currency, usually U.S. Dollar (USD), sometimes Pound Sterling (GBP) or Euro (EUR), as viewed from someone in the U.S. (included links might not always work outside the U.S.). Many phones will likely go on sale over the next few days/weeks, so keep that in mind when shopping. I've also explicitly included the country of origin for each company, as that can sometimes have an impact on the compatibility of the phones in certain other countries' networks (*cough cough Verizon*).




&amp;nbsp;

--------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

## **Considerations for Playing Pokemon Go**

**Battery**: For many players, this is probably the most important factor when playing the game. A good battery means you can get through a full Community Day without needing to bring a power bank with you. Capacity is given in units of milliamp-hours (mAh), and the average value for a modern phone is about 3000-4000 mAh. That mAh number isn't everything, though, as screen specs and power drawing from other hardware components can affect how long a full charge lasts. 

&amp;nbsp;

**RAM**: A phone's random access memory (RAM) is the amount of local memory that a phone can quickly work with. This is what dictates how many active apps you can have open at once (i.e. when you need to reload an app when switching between Pokemon Go and Discord/Telegram/WhatsApp/Messenger/etc.). I highly recommend a **minimum** of 4GB of RAM for an Android phone, as the operating system (OS) can sometimes take up to 1.5 GB on its own. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Processor**: All phones use a system on a chip (SoC) that roughly determines how well it runs apps/processes/tasks. Most Android phones use Qualcomm Snapdragon SoCs, which are separated by overall performace tier (600 and lower for budget, 700 for mid-range, 800 for flagship), generation, and incremental upgrades. For playing Pokemon Go, you should really go for a Snapdragon 600 series at the very least. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**Non-considerations**: This post is about picking a phone to play Pokemon Go. Thus, I've left out regularly discussing phone aspects that don't matter as much for gameplay such as cameras, charging speeds, 5G compatibility, and extra special features, though I might have one-off mentions if they help define a model. I occasionally mention display refresh rates, but it's not comprehensive. If any of these features are important for you when picking a phone, be sure to do your own research before buying!

&amp;nbsp;

*An Example*: I've used a 2017 Motorola Z2 Play with 3000 mAh battery, 3GB RAM, and a Snapdragon 626 for the past 2.5 years playing heavily (current Trainer stats: 136 million XP, 163,000 Pokemon caught, no Go+). Over roughly the same time, my girlfriend has used a 2017 Google Pixel 2 with 2700 mAh battery, 4GB RAM, and a Snapdragon 835 chip to play. Before we got these phones, we had used an iPhone 5s and 5, respectively, to play since launch.

During pre-pandemic 3 hour Community Days, I could comfortably play the whole time on a single full phone charge while my girlfriend would need to plug in around the last hour; the increased battery capacity and lower-end chip meant that my Z2 Play would last longer than her Pixel 2. However, my Z2 Play (purchased for about $380) is still waiting around for a promised Android 9 update but now also has MAJOR RAM issues; so much so that Pokemon Go frequently crashes presumably due to the system running out of RAM. Meanwhile, her Pixel 2 (purchased for about $800) is still going strong on Android 10 and can easily last another year or two even with the last device software update coming in December 2020. 

&amp;nbsp;

Feel free to keep this example and the previous considerations in mind as we go through each major phone brand alphabetically below. 

&amp;nbsp; 

--------------------------------------------------


&amp;nbsp;

## **[Apple](https://www.apple.com/iphone/)**

Apple is an American company that's no longer ""just"" a luxury brand. It now sells a wide range of phones, including some budget-friendly options. There's nearly an iPhone at every hundred-dollar increment from $399 to $1099 (in the U.S.; prices can be considerably higher in other countries). 

Performance-wise, iOS offers probably the smoothest Pokemon Go experience. Thanks to Apple's vertical integration, all parts of an iPhone (OS, software, hardware) are optimized for one another, allowing iPhones to have great performance even when their raw numbers don't look so impressive. Thus, it's not always useful to compare iPhone spec numbers to those of Android phones. Apple also offers the longest software support period for their devices from any phone maker (around **5** years!), so you'll continue to get OS and security updates for quite a while.

One important note is that when you buy an Apple device, you're buying into the Apple ecosystem. They want to force you to only use their devices by making interfacing with Apple products easy and with other devices sometimes near impossible. Keep that in mind before you jump in!

This year's highlights include: 

* **[iPhone 12 Pro Max](https://www.apple.com/iphone-12-pro/)** ($1099) - This year's top of the line iPhone model. It has a larger battery (3687 mAh), bigger screen, and better camera features than any of the other iPhone 12 models. Though it only has 6GB of RAM, Apple is able to make that go a long way. Go for this if you want the latest and greatest iPhone device, but check out the other iPhone 12 models if you want to shave off a few hundred dollars for pretty much the same experience (mostly losing camera features).

* **[iPhone SE (2020)](https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/)** ($399) - If you want that smooth iOS Pokemon Go experience but don't want to break the bank, this is the choice for you. It's the cheapest iPhone Apple's ever released, yet has the same chip as last year's iPhone 11. The SE has a seemingly tiny 3GB of RAM, but again, Apple is able to stretch that out. The biggest downside, however, is that its battery capacity is low (1821 mAh - the smallest of all phones in this post), so you'll definitely have to bring a portable charger to make it through a full Community Day. Some reviewers go as far as to recommend the iPhone 11 as the ""cheap iPhone option"" instead because of the anemic battery on the SE. 

&amp;nbsp; 


## **[Asus](https://www.asus.com/us/Phone/)**

Typically more known as a computer manufacturer, Asus is a Taiwanese company with a few entries in the phone market. In certain countries, however, they lack a traditional storefront (physical or even online), meaning that in order to buy their phones, you have to go through a third party seller. 

Here's a model that really stuck out: 

* **[ROG Phone 3](https://rog.asus.com/us/Phones/ROG-Phone-3-Model/)** ($999) - A phone that's specifically designed for gaming. Like, competitive first-person shooter gaming. With a 6000 mAh battery (the biggest of all the phones in this post), minimum 12GB RAM, Snapdragon 865+, and a flurry of other features, this phone is overkill if your primary purpose is playing Pokemon Go. In the U.S., it appears to be mostly compatible with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile networks, but not Verizon. 

&amp;nbsp;


## **[Google](https://store.google.com/us/category/phones)**

Rather than continuing to creep into the high-end market, Google's Pixel phones are cementing themselves as decisively mid-range. As the maker of the Android OS, Google is an American tech giant able to optimize their phones for a smooth experience similar to Apple with iOS, but to a slightly lesser extent. They offer 3 years of guaranteed OS and security updates, which is above average for Android phones. 

The best feature you get for the money is the camera. Pixel phones have a legendary camera for their price, which is nice, but not super relevant for Pokemon Go. Overall, however, they're solid products that run apps very well. 

This year's highlights include: 

* **[Pixel 5](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_5)** ($699) - Very respectable specs (4000 mAh battery, 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 765G) for the price of an upper mid-range phone. They're not spectacular, however, as its chipset in particular isn't the higher-end Snapdragon 865. But most users probably won't notice the loss in sheer, raw power. 

* **[Pixel 4a](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_4a)** ($349) - One of the two phones topping the lists of best budget phone of 2020, the Pixel 4a is even cheaper than its main competitors. Its internals are very clearly a step down (3140 mAh, 6GB RAM, Snapdragon 730G) from the Pixel 5, but should still be more than enough for any Trainer, especially at this price point. Oh, and it has a headphone jack!

&amp;nbsp; 


## **[HTC](https://www.htc.com/us/smartphones/)**

A Taiwanese company that once led innovation in the smartphone market. Heck they were the first ones to make Android phones! They've steadily been declining over the past decade, and have mostly shifted their focus to VR hardware. One other notable fact is that HTC played a big role in helping Google create their first Pixel phones. 

Today, HTC does still make phones, but they're typically hard to find. None are officially being sold in the U.S., so you'd have to go through third-party sellers. The phones they have are usually mid-range, but I haven't seen any favorable tech reviews, so I'll just move on.


&amp;nbsp; 

## **[Huawei](https://consumer.huawei.com/gh/phones/)**

This Chinese maker is one of the top phone sellers in the world, trading blows with Samsung and Apple. There was some recent controversy with this company over certain U.S. policy decisions that affected sales, though it remains to be seen whether that will continue in the future. Until there's a resolution, I can't exactly recommend any Huawei phones to a Western audience (plus tech reviewers don't always cover them). 

&amp;nbsp; 


## **[Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/smart-devices/-lenovo-smartphones/c/lenovo-smartphones)**

Another company that's better known for making computers. This Chinese brand actually owns Motorola (in fact, they tell you to just buy a Motorola phone if you're in the U.S.), but also has a few models that carry the Lenovo name. As far as I can tell, none of these Lenovo phones are specifically available in the U.S., though there are international unlocked versions out there. 

Here's one that's worth pointing out:

* **[Legion Duel](https://legion.lenovo.com/legion-phone-duel)** ($1049) - A very similar gaming phone to the Asus ROG Phone 3. The biggest trade-off is a smaller battery capacity (5000 mAh), though it charges faster. Definitely overkill for playing Pokemon Go, but if you have other mobile gaming aspirations and want a fast charging phone, then consider this one. 


&amp;nbsp; 

## **[LG](https://www.lg.com/us/cell-phones)** 

LG is a South Korean electronics company that has declined a bit in terms of phone market share, but still offers some innovative choices. These days, their phones aren't highly ranked in reviews, but there's still one entry that I thought was worth mentioning. 

* **[V60 ThinQ/Dual Screen](https://www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/v60-thinq-dual-screen)** ($799 to $949) - Do you want (the option of using) two full-sized screens? If so, then this might be the phone for you. With a 5000 mAh battery, 8 GB RAM, and a Snapdragon 865 chip, it's got the specs to power everything you want to do on those dual screens. The price that you'll have to pay for this phone varies based on your network carrier in the U.S., so don't get too attached until you do your homework. 


&amp;nbsp; 

## **[Motorola](https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones)**

Once a huge name in cell phone sales, Motorola is an American company that has declined throughout the smartphone era. However, it continues to make decent phones, some of which have been highly praised. Most of its offerings are budget phones, with many different options to choose from, so this is definitely a maker that you should consider if you're on a tight budget and live in the U.S. 

A relatively inconsequential but beloved feature of Motorola phones are the Moto actions. If you've ever used a Motorola phone, you'll know - chop your phone in midair to activate the flashlight, twist your phone along its long axis to open up the camera, etc. Small detail, but a lot of fun to play with.

Here are a couple of options from this maker: 

* **[Moto Edge+](https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-motorola-edge-plus/p)** ($999) - Motorola's first flagship phone in a few years, and it's a Verizon exclusive. 5000 mAh battery, 12GB RAM, Snapdragon 865, and a 90 Hz refresh rate make for an impressive device. Some downsides, though: lots of bloatware, not great vibration motor, bad fingerprint reader, and a screen that curves over the edges. 

* **[Moto G Power](https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-moto-g-power/p)** ($249) - If you're in the U.S. and need something cheaper than a mid-range phone, consider the Moto G Power. With 5000 mAh battery, 4GB RAM, and a Snapdragon 655, this should suffice for your PoGo needs. Its claim to fame is definitely that battery, as the RAM and SoC aren't too impressive. It's compatible with most major U.S. carriers and you should be able to grab it with some discount. Also, I wouldn't recommend any Android phones with lower RAM or chip specs than this if you want to play Pokemon Go on it for more than a year.

&amp;nbsp; 

## **[Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_us/smartphones)**

Nokia used to rule the world in phone sales, but now this company from Finland is just another (small) fish in the sea. Late in adapting to the smartphone revolution, Nokia is trying to make up for lost time by offering its own selection of Android phones. Unfortunately, none of their phones top any ""best phone of 2020"" lists, so I won't be calling out any specific models here. If you're in the market for truly budget phones in the U.S., however, Nokia (like Motorola) might be a good brand to look into. Just make sure the specs are good enough to sustain Pokemon Go in the long run.

&amp;nbsp; 


## **[OnePlus](https://www.oneplus.com/store/phone)**

This up-and-coming Chinese phone maker got its start making ""flagship-killer"" phones that packed in a ton of features while charging less than top makers. The specs in OnePlus phones are awesome for the price that you pay. You also get Oxygen OS, which is a reskinned Android OS for OnePlus that is sleek and often praised by reviewers. 

There are some notable potential obstacles in buying a OnePlus phone in the U.S., however. Some highly-praised models simply aren't released in the U.S., while others have support with only some networks (mostly T-Mobile, OnePlus's official U.S. partner). If you do manage to make it work, however, you'll soon find out exactly why tech reviewers absolutely love OnePlus. 

This year's highlights include: 

* **[OnePlus 8T](https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-8t)** ($749) - If you want all of the flagship features at a price that just barely puts it into the high-end category, the OnePlus 8T is the way to go. With 4500 mAh battery, 12GB RAM, Snapdragon 865, 120 Hz refresh rate, and warp charging, it's got great specs at an unbelievable price (to demonstrate, sneak a peek at the Samsung Note 20 Ultra!).

* **[OnePlus Nord](https://www.oneplus.com/uk/nord)** (¬£379) - This is the phone that I wish I could have bought. It's the other phone (besides the Google Pixel 4a) that tops the lists of best budget phones of 2020. 4115 mAh battery, 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 765G. It has the specs of a Google Pixel 5 for hundreds less (¬£379 GBP = $505 USD vs. Pixel 5's $699 USD). You also get a 90 Hz refresh rate for smoother animations. The downside? It's not sold in the U.S., and it's missing support for a few frequency bands that U.S. carriers use for their networks, so it probably won't work super well even if you do import one (especially on Verizon). There are pared-down Nord variants coming to the U.S. in the near future, but it's just not the same.

* **[OnePlus 7T T-Mobile version](https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-7t-tmo)** ($349) - If you really wanted the Nord, are stuck in the U.S., but are a T-Mobile customer, you might be in luck! With 3800 mAh battery, 8GB RAM, and a Snapdragon 855+ (compared to the 765G on the Nord, the 855+ is last year's model, but for a higher class of phones), you get roughly the same specs as the Nord for an even lower price! But again, it's only for T-Mobile customers.

&amp;nbsp; 

## **[Oppo](https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphones/)**

One of the largest phone makers in the world, thanks to its huge success in its home country of China. Most of its models aren't readily available in the west, and one of its most critically acclaimed phones, the Oppo Find X2 Pro, was undercut by the OnePlus 8T by hundreds of dollars. Oppo has some good budget and mid-range options, but apparently they're exceptionally hard to find outside of China or India, so I won't highlight any here. 


&amp;nbsp;

## **[Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/all-phones/)**

Samsung is a giant in the world of smartphone sales, often topping the list of most phones sold. The South Korean company offers a plethora of different phone models, and I can't pretend to comprehend how many different models they sell. 

A strange quirk is that the internal SoC in some models differs based on which region you buy from. Samsung is able to make their own chips, the Exynos brand, for less but performance sometimes lags behind that of the more common Qualcomm Snapdragon. 

This year's highlights include: 

* **[Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra](https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-note20-5g/)** ($1299) - Considered the best of the best, this is the phone that has all of the top features put together. 4500 mAh battery, 12GB RAM, Snapdragon 865+ (Americas, East Asia), 120 Hz refresh rate, and warp and wireless charging. This is the phone with that fancy pen stylus, whose latency has apparently been vastly improved. The battery life is supposedly boosted by the adaptive refresh rate of the phone, which will be lowered when apps don't need higher rates. But... just look at that price! I cri.

* **[Samsung Galaxy S20 FE](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-s20-5g/s20-fe-5g/)** ($699) - Priced as an upper mid-range phone, this one delivers one of the best values at this price point. A 4500 mAh battery, 6GB RAM, and a Snapdragon 865 chip makes this a very competitive phone. If you're able to get it on sale, that's even better! The main issue, however, is that even when discounted, it's still a bit expensive for people on a tight phone budget. But at least it's more widely available than similarly spec'd Xiaomi phones. 

* **[Samsung Galaxy A51](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a51-unlocked-sm-a515uzknxaa/)** ($399) - This is Samsung's most relevant competitor to the best value mid-range phones. It has a 4000 mAh battery, 4GB RAM, and an Exynos 9611 chip, which is comparable in specs, though you may want to consider getting more RAM. Overall, it's a good phone, but it doesn't outshine its mid-range competitors like the Pixel 4a or Nord by offering a better price or better specs. 

&amp;nbsp;


## **[Sony](https://www.sony.com/electronics/phones/t/smartphones)**

People might be surprised to hear that this massive Japanese tech conglomerate that's responsible for the Playstation and hundreds of consumer electronics also makes phones. Sony phones make up an almost invisible market share of phones sold, but according to tech enthusiasts, the phones are great thanks to the unconventional features that they include. 

Here's probably their the best model this year: 

* **[Xperia 5 ii](https://www.sony.com/electronics/smartphones/xperia-5m2)** ($949) - Sony's Xperia series has a few tricks up their sleeves. On paper, the phone looks alright: 4000 mAh battery, 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 865 chip, 120 Hz refresh rate. But the first thing people will notice is that this phone has a wonky aspect ratio - it's much, much taller than it is wide. It does this to be a more comfortable one-handed device, as well as achieving a more cinematic aspect ratio in landscape mode. You also get manual-level camera controls directly imported from Sony's professional camera lineup. Oh, and you get a 3.5 mm headphone jack, which is nearly impossible to find on phones at this price point. 

&amp;nbsp; 


## **[Vivo](https://www.vivo.com/en/products)**

Another Chinese phone maker whose products are mostly locked to mainland China, as far as I can tell. I haven't seen any specific models raved about by reviewers, so I'll again move on. 

&amp;nbsp;


## **[Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/global/)**

Another huge player in the market of phone sales, this Chinese company has been excelling in the developing markets of China and India. Western consumers are also starting to notice what this maker has to offer, both at the low and high end. However, U.S. consumers will likely be unable to use these phones to the full potential, as many of Xiaomi's huge suite of phones aren't fully supported in the U.S.

Nevertheless, here are a few models that really stand out: 

* **[Xiaomi Mi 10](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-10)** ($649) - On paper, you get a lot more than you'd expect from this phone based on its price. A 4780 mAh battery, 8GB RAM, and a Snapdragon 845 gives it flagship-level specs at a upper mid-range price. However, you might have trouble finding a place to buy it, and it might not work with certain networks (definitely not on Verizon in the U.S.). 

* **[Black Shark 3 Pro](https://global.blackshark.com/pages/blackshark3-pro)** ($899) - Xiaomi's gaming phone entry that has a very unique look. It has physical shoulder buttons that pop up when gaming in landscape orientation and liquid cooling(!). 5000 mAh battery, Snapdragon 865, 12GB of RAM, and a 90 Hz refresh rate all give it top-notch specs. But again, good luck getting it to work if you're in the U.S.

* **[Poco X3](http://www.poco.net/global/poco-x3-nfc/)** (¬£199) - On paper, this phone's stats do not match its asking price. 5160 mAh battery, 6GB RAM, Snapdragon 732G, and 120 Hz refresh rate all starting at ¬£199 GBP/‚Ç¨229 EUR/$250 USD. It's the best ultra affordable phone in 2020, but has some caveats. It's not fully compatible with U.S. networks and has ads built right into the OS (though I hear there is a way to disable this). If you can deal with these, then check this bad boy out. 

&amp;nbsp; 

------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp; 

## **Conclusions**

There's a myriad of options when buying a phone these days. Here, I've gone over some notable current examples from many of the major phone brands globally, but this is by no means a comprehensive treatment. In fact, this post is heavily biased towards the U.S. (this *is* Reddit, after all).

In my opinion, mid-range phones offer the best value for your money when buying a brand new phone. Budget options (under $200) really aren't suited for playing Pokemon Go for an appreciable amount of time, and you'll get more frequent slowdowns and crashes with each new game update. On the flip side, the specs on flagship phones are overkill for a game like PoGo and the huge price tags are daunting. You could always buy a flagship from a year or two ago for a deep discount (in fact, this is what many people recommend instead of buying a new, mid-range phone model), but you'll get that many years fewer in guaranteed OS and security updates. 

Doing the research for this post has given me some interesting insight into phones, brands, and networks. There's often some amazing choices out there that you've never heard about simply because it's not marketed in your country. Also, Verizon may be America's #1 network, but it absolutely sucks if you like a phone that isn't made by an American, European, or South Korean company. 

Lastly, to revisit my earlier example, I ended up purchasing a Google Pixel 4a for myself a few days ago to replace my Moto Z2 Play. I'm really looking forward to it and absolutely cannot wait to go catching and grind towards level 50 on my new device!

I hope this post has been helpful!

&amp;nbsp; 

## **Glossary**

* **Budget/Mid-range/Flagship** - These are the main smartphone categories that describe price and performance. Roughly speaking, a budget phone is anything under $300 USD, a mid-range is between $300 and $700, and a flagship (or high-end) is anything over $700. Flagship phones are the devices that makers cram all of the best features into. 

* **Display Refresh Rate** - The rate at which the screen updates - think frames-per-second. A higher number means a seemingly smoother animation. Most people won't notice a difference, but tech enthusiasts love higher rates. 60 Hz is typical, 90 Hz is the next step up, and some go as high as 120 Hz or 144 Hz. 

* **SoC (System on a chip)** - The primary processor that ties many of the components (CPU, graphics, GPS) of a smartphone together. Most Android phones use a Snapdragon SoC, while a few makers like Samsung, Huawei, and Apple create their own. There are different tiers and generations, and is often the primary indication for the performance of a phone.

* **RAM (random access memory)** - The local memory that a phone can quickly work with. This is what dictates how many active apps you can have open at once (i.e. what determines whether you need to reload apps when switching between Pokemon Go and Discord/Telegram/WhatsApp/Messenger/etc.). 

* **milliamp-hour** - Typical units for battery capacity. Literally, it represents how much current can be drawn from the battery per hour and technically simplifies to units of charge (Amp = Coulombs/Sec

* **Trade-in** - A business practice where you basically sell a retailer your old phone in order to get a discount on their product. Your trade-in doesn't need to be from the same maker, they'll take it regardless. The amount of cash you'll get in return is directly tied to the model and condition of your old phone; most old phones won't award any money, but it's more environmentally friendly than throwing it in the trash. 

* **5G** - The new, 5th generation standard in cellular data networking. It's an upgrade to 4G LTE, promising faster speeds, but the infrastructure isn't quite there yet. Many phone brands are coming out with 5G-compatible phones, but it's not really worth it yet, as 5G is incredibly short-range and there aren't enough receivers even in major cities.

And since France already has Klefki, the Druddigon cut-off line will be above the French border, so Druddigon will spawn in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland and the Baltic states.  


**Generation 6:**  
**Hawlucha:**  
Hawlucha is obviously based on a luchador, and will therefore most likely be exclusive to either Mexico or the entirety of Latin America.  


**Carbink:**  
Carbink is most likely based on the carbuncle, a creature from South American folklore, though mostly from Chile and surrounding areas. Therefore, I figured Carbink would be exclusive to the southern parts of South America.  


**Generation 7:**  
**Comfey:**  
Comfey is obviously based on a Hawaiian flower necklace, but limiting it to just Hawaii is **very** limiting, so I put it in the other Polynesian islands as well.  


**Oranguru:**  
Oranguru is based on an orangutan, which live in Southeast Asia, so that is where Oranguru can be found as well.  


**Passimian**:  
Passimian is based on a lemur, which live in Madagascar, so that is where Passimian can be found as well.  


**Komala:**  
Komala is a koala, so Komala will obviously be exclusive to Australia. I will be shocked if this one doesn't happen.  


**Turtonator:**  
Turtonator is based on various snapping turtles, but it especially resembles the mata mata, which lives in the Amazon basin. So Turtonator will be exclusive to the northern parts of South America.  


**Drampa:**  
Drampa is based on a Chinese dragon, so it will be exclusive to China and surrounding areas.  


**Generation 8:**  
**Stonjourner:**  
Stonjourner is obviously based on Stonehenge, so it will be exclusive to the United Kingdom.  


**Eiscue:**  
Eiscue is a penguin, so it will spawn in locations where penguins live in the real world (the southern parts of South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica).  


**Falinks:**  
Falinks is most likely based on a squad of Roman legionnaires, so Falinks will spawn in areas that used to belong to the Roman Empire: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman\_Empire#/media/File:Roman\_Empire\_Trajan\_117AD.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire#/media/File:Roman_Empire_Trajan_117AD.png)  
So basically:  


* Italy
* France
* Spain
* Portugal
* the southern half of England and the Netherlands
* Belgium
* parts of Switzerland, Germany, Austria and the Balkan
* Greece
* Turkey
* Israel
* Egypt
* the Mediterranean coast

And lastly, [Oricorio](https://gamefaqs1.cbsistatic.com/user_image/7/3/2/AAUu8BAABLIU.jpg)**:** 

* Pom-Pom style Oricorio (the Electric/Flying one) will be exclusive to the continental United States
* Baile style Oricorio (the Fire/Flying one) will be exclusive to Spain (and possibly South America)
* Sensu style Oricorio (the Ghost/Flying one) will be exclusive to Japan
* Pa'u style Oricorio (the Psychic/Flying one) will be exclusive to Hawaii, New Zealand and the other Polynesian islands",My speculation regarding future regional-exclusive Pokemon,pokemongo
I was playing Pokemon go at 5:00pm and it is now 8:00pm. I put 2 pokemons in separate gyms they finally came back. The notification popped up and said each one earned 50 coins but I do not see it in the shop and when I checked the journal and the news section there are no coins. This happened several times but with pokemons that have been in gyms for 2 days minimum. I need help.... Maybe I don't know how the whole gym coins work or maybe I'm doing something wrong. I have closed the game and I also restarted the entire phone. Can someone please help me?,Gym coins not appearing,pokemongo

"In the interests of Pokedexes and friendship, people are inviting each other to raids all over the world to capture members of the Lake Trio. I'm the happy guy who finally registered Uxie that way! In turn, I've been helping people with our local member of the trio- Azelf.

It's that time of year, so all of you new Azelf owners need to be aware of what needs to be done with one this time of year, lest horrible catching luck and rare Pokemon never spawning for you occur for all of 2021.

You see, Azelf will now be reporting back to Arceus every day as to whether or not you're a good Pokemon trainer, and each morning will find itself a new place to hang out at in order to watch your goings on. It's a good idea to pay attention to where your Azelf decides to perch each day, as they love knowing you care and will tell Arceus as much. Especially if you take pictures. But don't touch (unless it's your Buddy, they're a little sensitive) or your Azelf may just decide to hang around and be petted and stuffed with Berries instead of doing their job, in which case you can forget about the good luck next year.

This will continue for about a month from now, after which Azelf's yearly review is done and you're either good for 2021 or going to be catching Rattatas and nothing else until the beginning of 2022. And we don't want that.

I'm including a link to a picture to show you what it's like. Good luck for the next month, it's already watching you!

So what crazy ideas do y'all have?

Color Cup - sounds ridiculous, but it'll be easy enough for people to plan around. Pick a specific color (like yellow) and all eligible Pokemon have to have that color. Maybe it could be matched to specific holidays, like green for St Patrick's Day.

"[Link to Speed Paint of Barboach on YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/7zqPueZLvvw) (If anyone know how to post a screen shot while the embed feature is off, let me know.)

 Hey Everyone!! Kali Lyon here with my tribute to this week's Pok√©mon Go Spotlight Hour, Barboach. He has been out shiny for a while, but it is still a great chance to catch this ground fish for his evolution, Whiscash, that dominated the great league for some time. Also the extra candy isn't bad to power him to CP1500.   

There were two sketch concepts for today's painting. One is as seen above,  while the other played on the Masterball joke from the Pok√©mon Anime. (Incase you thought a Masterball could catch anything this fish line will prove you wrong.) I felt that it would reach more audience if I did ""Fishing for a Shiny"" instead.

"A few weeks ago or so I decided to install Pok√©mon GO again after 3 years of absence. Due to my fairly old iPhone it crashed occasionally the first hour of gameplay or so, but after that it ran fine. A few days ago, the game began to crash at very specific times and it has caused the game to become nearly unplayable.

It crashes each and every time I open the friend list, it crashes every time I merely look at my own profile, it crashes every time I look inside a gym, it crashes nearly every time I start a raid battle (resulting in me spending my raid pass and not earning anything from it) and it crashes frequently when doing any kind of battle. I haven't experienced *any* crashes outside of these.

I can still wander around and catch Pok√©mon and spin Pok√©-stops but most key-features crash. I have already looked into this and I've tried every solution from every post I found throughout the web and nothing has worked. My iPhone is up to date on the latest iOS, Pok√©mon GO is up to date and I've tried disabling most background actions that could slow down the game.

Seriously. Screw shiny meltan events. They only give you two chances to do it basically because you can't open the box without waiting 3 days. Only lasts a week? Wtf were they thinking? I spent the whole hour of each of them on two different accounts trying to get to stupid thing and all I have to show is like 200ish meltans. No shinies. Now I have to probably wait 4 more years just to see the stupid thing come back only to not appear shiny after wasting another 4 hours of my life chucking balls at this stupid creature. Overall very disappointed with the event. See you guys whenever this shiny is actually obtainable again because I cant even stomach this game now.,The quest for shiny meltan.(rant),pokemongo

"Hi guys, I want to tell the story about I failed a shiny Meltan due to the freezing Pokeball glitch, how I reclaimed it and how I missed the event for the second shiny Meltan.

Sorry that if I didn't have the evidence photos, my phone doesn't have a photo/video app installed.

Okay, here it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday, I opened up my mystery box of a chance of Meltan appearing in the wild to hunt for Shiny Meltan, I was catching hundreds of normal Meltan in my current hometown (which my Mum lived in Rutherford, Australia) and I founded out that there's no shiny around my house. 3 days later, when I went to my Dad's house for a 2-night sleepover, I opened up my mystery box again and I was catching a quarter bunch of Meltan and not trying to waste all of my Pokeballs to save up if I found a shiny Meltan. However, when I ran into the Shiny Meltan and I touched the Pokeball in order to capture it, the touch screen froze itself and Pokeball stopped moving or working. I was trying to use the berry to increase the chance of the capture rate. I was really concerned/scared if that precious and rarest pokemon might run away from me. Sadly, it did... 

It did when I turned off my phone and turning it on again and I was really pissed off because of that shitty ass touch screen glitch. I was going to catch that shiny Meltan for the evolution of shiny Melmetal and it's gone forever. So, I created another account of mines and went on hunting another one to reclaim it. But, the shiny Meltan didn't spawn onto my second POGO account. I was really pissed and upset about that unfair shiny fail glitch. 

On Saturday morning, I created my third POGO account and when I was hunting for Shiny Meltan, I finally found and reclaimed it for Melmetal. I used it as my buddy until my third account levels up to Level 10 in order to trade. Unfortunately, I got no one to trade with and I friended all of my accounts myself to transfer my Shiny Meltan to my main account (in level 20) even I might use my other device for a trade.

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday, I was thinking of using my brother's device, but I thought that would be stealing. Anyway, after dinner, I opened up my last mystery box for a second shiny Meltan, I was hunting it for over 1 hour and in my second account, I was hunting for shiny Meltan for over 1 hour as well. Unfortunately, my home area doesn't even have any shiny Meltan just like on Tuesday and it was too late to earn a chance for a second Shiny Meltan just to keep it as the form of Meltan. 

The worst thing that I realized is that I can't get shiny Meltan in Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu or Eevee until I can catch one in Pokemon Go. Because of that, I had to wait for now a few more years until the Shiny Meltan comes out again. I was thinking of asking anyone if they had spare shiny Meltan to trade with for me to transfer it to Sword and Shield and keep it as a basic form, but again, that might be stealing.

Now, my luck is gone and there's no way I would be able to earn a second shiny Meltan again until the event comes again.

So, that's the end of my story about my Shiny Meltan adventure and all about my issues that happened in literally 4 days. (including today)

Hope you guys can help me and enjoy my stressful story.",A story about Shiny Meltan adventure during the event.,pokemongo

"I will be posting this to multiple chats to help everyone. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get some negative comments about how stupid my idea is or whatever.

Although this idea won‚Äôt benefit everyone a lot but it‚Äôs an idea that I think would benefit a lot of players.

I‚Äôm just trying to save people money. Instead of blowing hundreds of dollars or thousand this method will be super effective if we can get the ball rolling. But also need everyone‚Äôs help or advice to make this possible.

Discord has a member limit capacity of 500 000 I believe. I would like this to occur on a global scale if possible. 

When you ADD a new friend and first interaction you get 3000 xp on lucky egg that‚Äôs 6000 xp.

If you had a blank friends list or if you‚Äôre fast enough and had 200 or more interaction on one lucky egg that‚Äôs a minimum of 1.2 million xp on one lucky egg. 


***
For these discord channels there would be 2 separate sections. 

1. One section is for posting friends code IF you CAN open gifts, with lucky egg on

2. Second section you can only post IF you CANNOT open. BUT can send! Which will require the person who added you to open your gifts. With  lucky egg on. 

3. Delete friends after maxing out on opening gifts and repeat the process number 2. Next day you could do it again, it‚Äôll only require 30 minutes to a hour a day if you‚Äôre serious about xp gain.

4. So these channels would constantly be spamming friends code for the sole purpose of xp gain only.

Not saying people need to spend hours a day doing this but for casual players who haven‚Äôt reach level 40 this will help if we can get these discord/or whatever you guys recommend going. I don‚Äôt have enough expertise in this field to organize this mass scale.

But if this method is effective people could reach 176 million easily aka level 50 in under a year. 

Open to others helping refine my ideas. But coordinating friends code on a global scale has never been done but I want everyone to get to level 40 or 50 without spending hundreds or thousands.",Pogo XP to lvl 40 &amp; 50,pokemongo

"Hello r/Pok√©mongo members fun story here so I hope you enjoy. Btw this is my first post, I‚Äôm usually pretty shy when it comes to posting n commenting but this was a must share.

Last night I used as I was watching a sports game and doing homework I thought it would be a good idea to use my black box to get some meltans. I was just casually catching Meltans and then I got a shiny, I was rlly happy :). I noticed how similar it looks to the original Melton but was still ecstatic to catch the special Pok√©mon. I continued to catch meltans. I had my Pok√©mon set in order of recent so it would be easier to transfer the ones I didn‚Äôt need Bc Ik time is key w these meltan boxes. So after I caught a meltan I would leave the Pok√©mon screen w/out checking it‚Äôs ivs and then go back to my inbox of Pok√©mon to check and transfer if it was bad. Well I found a way to make a mistake (remember how I said I thought they looked the same) and went back to my Pok√©mon inbox after I caught a meltan n some how threw away the shiny meltan instead of the recently caught meltan. I was half focus Bc I was watching a sports game and doing my online hw at the same time so i didn‚Äôt noticed I threw away the wrong one till the next meltan spawn. I proceeded to go insane when I found out it was missing. It was panic, (where did it got, it has to be here it was just here) Then straight rage, I cursed everything out, the tv, my laptop, my computer, my own hand, I even hit my punched my head and slapped myself a few times (it was actually quite a few times but let‚Äôs just say ‚Äúa few times‚Äù so I don‚Äôt look as dumb) as punishment for my foolishness(haha). It‚Äôs been a day not since it happened and  I‚Äôve accepted my HUGE mistake n whimper a few times when I think of it but it Ik it won‚Äôt come back.

"This discord is for a friendly raiding experience!! We host raids daily!! https://discord.gg/yqKXvVxd   
Join us!!",Join our discord!!,pokemongo
"If you aren‚Äôt a part of r/pokemongofriends I suggest you join because these tips are based solely off of that community if you don‚Äôt have a major Pok√©mon go circle personally. It has thousands of online players who are constantly posting friend codes and available raids for you to join remotely as well as post them yourselves. 

Raiding: STOP raiding with only 5 remote players. If you don‚Äôt know the 10 player trick, here it is again:

Accept 10 requests or have 10 available raiders online and ready. Start the raid and immediately add the first 5 players. When one person joins the raid, get ready to leave the raid. Timing is important. Once someone has entered, jump out of the raid and jump back in with 70 seconds remaining. For example, if you have a player who joins your raid and you have 90 seconds left, jump out and then rejoin the raid after you wait 20 seconds. When you jump back in you want to have between 60 - 70 seconds left for the raid. You‚Äôll then see that you are able to add another group of 5. Then, very quickly add another group of 5. Again, timing is important because your second round of 5 players now only have 50 - 60 seconds to get your invite and to join. Make sure you do it as fluid and quickly as possible to ensure you get a full 10 players. But wait! There‚Äôs more! When you add them and complete the raid, you should have between 9 - 10 players that are now your friend and you have achieved the ‚Äúgood friend‚Äù level with them, which is worth 3000 XP or 6000 XP with a lucky egg per player. However it‚Äôs important that you wait at least 5 minutes for your game to register your new friend status and award you the XP. Just wait until it tells you in the bottom left corner that you have received the XP. So, if done right, and you dropped a lucky egg, your tier 5 raid should award you around 75,000 XP. If you can do a few of those within your 30 minute lucky egg time frame, you could have minimum 150,000 XP in under 30 minutes or less.  

Friend and gift grind: Again, this is possible with the help of r/pokemongofriends 

Just like stated above, a ‚Äúgood friend‚Äù level is worth 3000 XP or 6000 XP with a lucky egg and only requires that you become friends and exchange/open gifts. Drop a lucky egg. You can open 20 gifts a day. If you can friend 20 new players, send each other gifts and open each other‚Äôs gifts back to back right at the time of request, you can get a maximum of 120,000 XP that day. 

So think about that. If you drop a lucky egg and time it all correctly, you can receive 270,000 XP in 30 minutes with one lucky egg. All you would need is 2 tier 5 raids near you and good communication with a post on this community for friend requests and gift exchange and it‚Äôs very possible. It‚Äôs a fast way to grind out that XP and if you could access 1 lucky egg a day, you could be gaining 1,000,000+ XP every 4 days excluding daily playing. 

Good luck and grind on!",Tips for maximizing XP through raiding and gift exchanges.,pokemongo

"Just an update on my journey from Level 33 to Legacy 40.

So I didn't achieve my goal of Level 35. I still managed to gain over 450,000 EXP but, due to some poorly timed Lucky Eggs/Raids, I was unable to reach Level 35 as I had intended. I was pleasantly surprised when one of my Special Research Tasks gave me a Lucky Egg.

I'll definitely be able to reach it over the next 24 hours which will supply me with one last Lucky Egg to use on my journey (AFAIK, I haven't checked if there's one hiding in another of my Special Research Tasks). I need to be really careful with this one.

I want to reach at least Level 36 before December at which point my progress should skyrocket due to the EXP changes. Ideally I'd reach Level 37 but we'll see how we go.

"I'm often hesitant to use the catching feature as I don't want it to let a good pokemon get away (I always let it spin for me unless I don't want to fill up and am saving room for something) but, given that shiny's never run away (correct?), is it 'safe' to use the autocatch feature to let the device catch any available shiny's that it comes across?  

I'm specifically thinking of doing this when opening a meltan mystery box.  I'm on my 3rd box so I have plenty of candy, and I get tired of catching them after a while, so I was thinking of using the autocatch device.  Given that I'm not walking/driving around, it should attempt to catch every meltan that spawns in my house, correct?  And since shiny's never escape, it should catch any shiny that appears, right?

I might also consider doing this at a nest, where I don't care of the particular pokemon gets away, but I want to be sure to capture any shinys.

"I saw what they did with Giratina having both forms appear on Legendary Raids and I'm guessing they will do the same with Black/White Kyurem but I'm curious on how will it work for mythicals (e.g. Shaymin, Meloetta, Keldeo)

Are they going to make them region exclusive? Land form Shaymin in the southern hemisphere and Sky form Shaymin the northern hemisphere?

Maybe the base form will be obtainable thru research and the other form will be obtainable thru raids? 

With the arrival of mega-evolutions we get access to temporary transformations. Perhaps this is something that could be applied for the mythicals also?

Also with Manaphy and Phione (i know they aren't really ""forms"" but do you think they'll make a special research where the final reward is a Manaphy encounter plus a 20km egg that contains Phione.

"After level 40+  update will be made available to all players after December 1st, we will be able to get XL candy, its a new type of candy used for powering up pokemon beyond level 50.

XL candy can be obtained in multiple ways and one of the ways is by transferring pokemon.

XL candy is much harder to come by than normal candy for rare pokemon, it will be good idea to keep the rare pokemon in hand so that we can transfer them after the update rolls out to get xl candy of rare pokemon. 


Regarding Meltan, we can always get its normal candy now due to the home system.

Niantic is very likely to allow level 50 pokemon in GBL so if we keep all our meltan until the update rolls out we can transfer all our meltan to get enough XL meltan candy to max a melmetal to 50 to use in master league.

I heard that there is limit of getting xl candy from melmetal from silph road. The limit reported is 150 meltan per day. So if you have more than 150 to transfer transfer them in batches. 

Maxing to 50 is possible for level 40 players too and a level 50 melmetal will be good asset in master league as melmetal is now rank 2 in open master league according to pvpoke.com and a level 50 one will give you an upper hand if level 50 pokemon will be allowed next season.",PSA: Don't tranfer Rare Pok√©mon especially meltan during the double tranfer candy spotlight hour.,pokemongo

"Would it be a feasible idea to make an account for the sake of various people, most likely set groups, around the world to get pokemon region-locked in their area for others to log into and trade to themselves so they can obtain them?

Given that there's the limited trading distance there's no way to easily obtain these pokemon in your area unless the game graces us with an event including them. Even that, its usually specific areas and cities for these pokemon when they do them. I personally have no chance of obtaining the likes of Torkoal, Tropius, and many other like them naturally since I'll most-likely never travel for them.

I'd imagine that a group could set themselves up with an account that they can all share and log into at different times and catch whatever pokemon are region-locked in their area for others to take for their dex's. There would of course need to be another phone to help with the actual trading process to each individual person, either a spare or a friend's.

"I was today years old when I realized that these fully heal your gym Pok√©mon, and I almost never use them so I have 60 of these things.

"For the sake of helping the devs track down this bug, I'll list as many details as I can think of.

Because you're allowed to swap your buddy pok√©mon 20 times a day, I've started a new practice of swapping them often, in order to get all 20 pok√©mon four hearts per day.

Here's the pattern I take: play with the Pokemon, give it three berries, pet it, and take a snapshot. I will then battle in a gym with that Pokemon. I typically just fight one Pokemon, defeat them and reduce their overall CP, and then retreat from the fight. I then repeat this process after swapping out Pokemon from the buddy role.

Sometimes when I start one of these gym fights, the Pokemon will swap to the previous Pokemon that occupied the buddy roll.

For example, let's say I take out my tyranitar, give him berries, pet him, take a snapshot of him, and then battle him in a gym. Then I swap to my Mewtwo. Same thing. Take them out to play, three berries, pets, snapshot. Then I start another battle. And in the very first second of that battle, Mewtwo will be swapped for tyranitar.

To be even more clear, the fight starts with Mewtwo in the first fighting slot. And when the battlefield is getting set up and the Pokemon take the field, Mewtwo is standing there. And then the fight starts, and Mewtwo makes the animation for when a Pokemon retreats into a pokeball. And then tyranitar appears. As if I swap the Pokemon.

I am definitely not swapping the Pokemon. After it happened twice today, I took extra care to not touch the screen in order to make sure it wasn't me swapping them.

Additionally, tyranitar wasn't even in any of the six slots when I went into the gym fight. So I could not have swapped tyranitar into the fight because tyranitar was not one of the six Pokemon I brought into the fight at the start. Let alone in the first slot.

One more observation, I find I get this problem less often if I take more time between gym fights.","[Bug] Sometimes, when I battle pokemon in a gym, my first pokemon will get swapped at the beginning of the fight",pokemongo

"The appeal of PoGo, for *me*, has always been a pretty simple catch and collect game. Filling the dex has been enough - seeing a new Pokemon on the map hasn't ever stopped being exciting. But those moments seem fewer and farther between as of late, as it seems the focus is mostly shifted onto earning access to new Pokemon via challenges and battles. 

I should make it clear that I'm not upset that they've fleshed out the game for a bigger experience; yes, it's been difficult to participate in Raids or even level up my Pokemon to the point they're effective to achieve some of the tasks that gate off certain content, but a ton of people really enjoy that stuff so I've just sort of accepted that there are certain Pokemon I'll never get outside of a trade, if at all. 

But with every new update that adds a new feature, I feel like I'm just falling further and further behind and it's making it very difficult to feel that continuing to play the game is even worth it.

It takes me months to finish most Special Research. I STILL have only beat 1/3 Rocket Leaders, and I can only just slightly chip away at Giovanni before I'm destroyed. Remote Raiding has been amazing, but affording Remote Raid passes isn't easy when I can't really find the time to go take down a gym (or when I do, get kicked out within half an hour, or worse, take 3 gyms and have all 3 Pokemon returned to me on the same day). I'm still stuck on 38/40 Ghost Pokemon for crying out loud, because I couldn't catch enough during the even and they. just. don't. spawn around me. 

I really don't mean to whine or complain. I have enjoyed the game for over 4 years and I've appreciated that really nothing is *truly* locked behind a paywall, though there is *absolutely* an imbalance when it comes to rural vs urban players.

And now, with the level cap being raised and a deadline for reaching level 40 instituted with exclusive content locked behind it, it just feels like 4 years worth of effort, trying my best to keep up, isn't worth it.

I'm just wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same fatigue, or loss of plot, or whatever you want to call it?

I would love for an alternate version of PoGo, call it ""Pokemon GO: Safari"" or something, where literally the only point is to catch Pokemon. Make it a one-time purchase and I'd buy the game. Keep in the same microtransaction model that PoGo has and I'd be fine with that, too... as long as so much of the content wasn't gated behind time commitment or access to PokeStops/Gyms etc.

"I made an XP Calculator for my partner Bug Catcher, who didn't think he could make it to Legacy 40 in time.  Turns out, he's been ahead of schedule 3 days in a row!

The sheet calculates how many XP you need each day, adjusting the goals you get ahead or fall behind, and suggests interactions to get you there, with or without a Lucky Egg.  You can make a copy for your own use, or watch the public version of our tallies to cheer us on!

To use the sheet, just type your XP in the column labeled ""Type XP Here"".  If you are behind where we were when you copied the spreadsheet, you'll need to put your current XP into all the past dates to make it work.  If you're ahead of us, it will jump to where you are and do just fine going forward with no need to change the old entries.

If you know you are going to do a certain interaction for the day--make several Ultra Friends or a Best Friend for example--you can type that in as a Planned Interaction and the suggested interactions adjust to match.  Or, if you're all out of raid passes and know you won't be doing any raids, you can set the Planned Interactions for raids to zero and everything else will be adjusted up to help you still meet your goal.

I would like to start out by saying that I take no umbridge with the people in charge of creating the rules for this subreddit. I also would like to say that I understand the reason behind 2b. I am merely complaining on the fact that this rule restricts me and many others from posting at all. 

Rule 2b states that all non ar screenshots must be posted as a link in a text submission. This is impossible for me because I literally cannot get a link to any photos on my phone or computer at all.

"So I was almost at the point where I could max out what I have that's been released and been happy, but after learning I'll have to at least double all my previous efforts soon, I figured it's definitely time to plan out what I need to save for, and what I can do now to make space in both bag and pokemon storage. I'm also considering trying to just clean out all 1,000+ rare candies and many of my 200+ CTMs so I have some breathing room. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I was messing around with the type chart ([https://www.dragonflycave.com/typechart.html](https://www.dragonflycave.com/typechart.html)) and discovered that Fire, Water, Steel, Fairy, Fighting, Rock, Dark, and Ground will hit everything super effectively except for the waters, which Electric + Grass should be able to handle fine. Especially in light of the level cap being raised I am fine using not-the-absolute-best counters if they're good enough and help me save on hard to get candy and/or stardust. Here is a mega list of what I have and what I am considering adding:

&amp;#x200B;

Steel: I have 5 currently maxed Metagross, and another that does have Meteor Mash but somewhat poor IVs. I think I can safely just say 6 of these will be all I ever need for steel coverage.

&amp;#x200B;

Water: Have 5 maxed Gyarados and 2 lvl 33 or so Kyogre. I'm thinking 5 Gyarados and one of those Kyogre ECTM'd with Origin Pulse should be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Dark: Have 5 maxed Tyranitar. Love Tyranitar. May have the sixth be a Hydreigon to save on candies.

&amp;#x200B;

Rock: Have 3 maxed Tyranitar. Love Tyranitar. May need to fill in the other 3 slots with something like Rhyperior if I can't get a huge amount of Tyranitar candy though.

&amp;#x200B;

Fairy: Have a Togekiss. Could get another or max out the first. Love Sylveon, Xerneas, and possibly Zacian. Not even built yet, partly because. . .

&amp;#x200B;

Ice: Have 3 maxed Mamoswine. Love Kyurem. Was thinking of going for 5 Mamoswine and a Kyurem, though I forget if Black or White is better. May just scrap altogether now once the fairies come in force though to save on stardust and grinding.

&amp;#x200B;

Fire: Have a bunch of random stuff. Seems like the easiest may be a mix of like 4 Charizard and 2 Blaziken. Love Ho-oh. Maybe 3 Charizard, 2 Blaziken, 1 Ho-oh. 

&amp;#x200B;

Electric/Grass: Have a couple Tangrowth, a UL Venusaur, couple Zekrom, 4 Electivire, a Magnezone that I can max or add a second, and a Zapdos. I'm thinking maybe Venusaur, Tangrowth, Zekrom, Magnezone, and 2 Electivire. Eclectic, but really only needed for Kyogre raids I think.

&amp;#x200B;

Ground: Have a Groudon with some investment and a ton of already transferred candy. Probably ECTM when Precipice blades drop. Don't have a whole lot to back it up, have one Excadrill. Rhyperior might be needed for Rock, so may just need to go hard during Garchomp CD? Not a huge fan of Garchomp or Landorus. Maybe have to do Groudon, Excadrill, and 4 Garchomp?

&amp;#x200B;

Dragon: Have 4 maxed Rayquaza, 1 maxed Dragonite. 2 shiny Rayquaza, Dialga, and a Latios. A few backup Rayquaza, Dragonite, and Salamence.  May also need to just abandon when fairies drop to save on stardust.

&amp;#x200B;

Fighting: Have an old duo-Tyranitar Machamp team. Also a maxed Blaziken. Looking to add Conkeldurr and Lucario, possibly also a Buzzwole. Maybe Blaziken, Buzzwole, and 4 Lucario? Assuming we ever get like a Lucario raid day or long-term farming mega raids or something to be able to get so much candy for him. With my best Machamp being kept for a long time until Buzzwole comes on the scene. 

&amp;#x200B;

Total Legendaries: Have a fair few Mewtwo, with a variety of charged moves so could probably slot one in somewhere if needed. One Groudon and two Kyogre partially powered up, will probably keep at least one of each when their signature moves come out. Ho-oh, would like to use for fire team but may need to let go. Shiny Lugia, partially powered, largely kept for fighting-type raids/gym battles, but may abandon/trade now. May look to get a Registeel again if it's still good in PvP. Latios, partially powered, may keep for gyms or may need to abandon. 4 Maxed Rayquaza, may abandon for fairies. Dialga, might keep and power up for PvP. Giratina, may power up an alternate for UL. Zekrom, would like to use at least one for anti-water team. A couple good Kyurem including a perfect, may abandon for fairies. Xerneas, may not be worth keeping. Zacian/Zamazenta might be worth getting and keeping one. Marshadow might be cool. Buzzwole might be nice. 

&amp;#x200B;

PvP: 

&amp;#x200B;

ML: Dialga, Groudon, Gyarados? A little clueless here.

&amp;#x200B;

UL: Giratina, Gyarados, Snorlax, Scizor, Hariyama, Weavile, Vaporeon, Venusaur, Charizard, Swampert, Zapdos, Sirfetch'd, Jolteon, Gardevoir, Lapras, Togekiss, Milotic, Lucario all possibilities. Have had decent success with Charizard/Venusaur/Swampert charge move spam.

&amp;#x200B;

GL: Scizor, Azumarill, Lanturn, Obstagoon, A-Ninetales, Toxicroak, Umbreon, Melmetal, Hitmonlee, Sirfetch'd, Lapras, Gyarados, Beedrill, Magneton, Hitmonchan, Skarmory, Jirachi, Mew, Scrafty, Milotic, Hitmontop, Stunfisk, Dragonair, Altaria, Snorlax, Shadow Snorlax, Munchlax, Shadow Mewtwo, Bastiodon, Forretress, Zweilous, Lucario all possibilities now or in the nearer future. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, just trying to compile a list of what I should be keeping and powering up to most efficiently use dust and grinding time/energy. Like I said I've still got just over a thousand rare candies to burn so can probably keep and use some sub-par legendaries. Might want to convert as much as I can right now to make room and hopefully will be able to farm a ton more for the future legendaries that I'll want to add.  Hopefully a lot of the meta-relevant Pokemon get their CD redone once XL candy gets rolled out.",Team planning in the midst of the rising level cap. What should I plan on grinding for to power up?

So I've been playing the game for a while and ever since PvP became a thing I've been collecting meta relevant Mons to use in all the different leagues of which I play Master League the most.

As I couldn't upload a picture on mobile I included a scrollshot of my potential ML mons with their IVs on their nicknames. As for movesets, most do have 2 Charge moves with the exception of not yet Lv40 mons as well as some others although a second one could always be bought.

- FP Groudon 
- MM Metagross

"Magmar CD just ended here and here's my take on it.

Total Magmar caught: 422

Total shiny: 19

Total 3*: 114

Total 4*: 0

Right of the bat I'll tell you it's way better than Electabuzz's CD. The catch rate is your typical easy CD catch, hardly need berry and usually just a one throw.

I didn't really went ham this CD though because fatigue from last CD is one thing while Magmar is something I already have a complete shiny family and lots of candy.

But there's always new players so we always have to keep in mind of that. Plus, with all this XL candy stuff and level 40 beyond stuff, it's best to grind candy and XP and dust again.

The usual CD perks like CD pokestop research, 5 photobombs, special research Magmortar knows Thunderbolt are still there so that's nice.

Again there's a free research for everyone too, another nice stuff from Niantic. Although Sinnoh stones are something I have way too much, even from last week.

I don't really like to hatch stuff during CD, my main focus is catching, no matter what the boost. So I myself can't comment on the hatches. But from my pals message group, their consensus are as follows: Stops don't always drop 2km egg (last CD is almost always 2km egg), and 2km is usually but not always Magby. Everyone got at least 1 shiny Magby after 10 or so eggs.

The gripe I have is that this bug is still there: When you click on a Pokemon who just ran away, the screen is frozen and you have to restart. At least the last bug you went to a white screen but still can escape by clicking on spawn location on screen.

In general, your typical CD, a fun one and definitely an improvement from the last.

To follow your progress, you'd have to take screenshots of your XP bar and compare them every couple of months. Or look at the numbers.

If anything, I think it's kind of depressing to even try to get more XP because the milestones are so far apart from each other. The ""rush"" for getting to level 47 from 46 for example is hardly worth the effort.

I think there should be some kind of motivator to keep players interested and motivated, like a small reward (couple of incubators, a piece of clothing or SOMETHING) per every X amount of XP gained. Those level ups are far too big chunks on themselves and only makes the player feel hopeless.

"So, I did it.  And I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit it.  

Despite the advice of 99% of this community, I purified my shadow mewtwo.  Here is why I think the statement ‚Äúyou should never purify shadow mewtwo‚Äù falls apart.

There is a non-insignificant time and resource investment discrepancy between the two.  Shadow mewtwo is always better, but at the cost of hundreds of thousands of dust and hundreds of candy.  Maybe that is of small consequence to some, but as a very casual player, this is the difference of me getting an instantly usable mewtwo in raids (if I purify) to having to wait probably 4 months or more to have a usable shadow mewtwo.  

For me, I didn‚Äôt like the thought of putting 4 months of effort into a Pok√©mon that was only 6-6-12.  The stats aren‚Äôt good... will it do more than if I purified?  Sure, but for an amount of effort I didn‚Äôt deem worthy of my time.  

So, for me, the right choice was purifying.  You have to enjoy the journey, and I can say I‚Äôll me much happier on my journey using a newtwo today, and waiting however long I have to for another shot at one that is worthy of the time investment.",I Purified My Shadow Mewtwo and Other Hysterical Musings,pokemongo

After wasting one hour without getting anything, I assumed I needed some ""minimun level"" to unlock the Meltan spawn.

"Hello everyone. I was just reading on Gamepress about legacy and elite moves and learned a lot that I didn't know.  One thing I read I have some questions about.
They suggest that players not use their elite TMs on community day Pok√©mon because there's always an event in December that gives you the opportunity to learn all or any of the elite moves that were ever featured during past community days.
First off, am I understanding that correctly, that at some point in December I'll have access to all of these moves?
Secondly, if the above is true, am I understanding correctly that in order to do so I'll need to evolve these Pok√©mon during that time in order for them to receive the elite moves?
Thirdly, if so, what about Pok√©mon that have multiple elite moves? Which would they learn, or is it that past community day Pok√©mon only have one elite move?
I think that's all the questions I have, but if anyone familiar with this recognizes that I'm overlooking something important then please mention that as well.

I started playing in late March, 2020, and I'm still constantly learning new things about the game and probably there's even more things that I've yet to discover/learn how they work.  If what I asked about above is true I wish I had know that before, as I've evolved many of those Pok√©mon, some quite recently, and I'm sure that for some I no longer have the required candy to evolve another one and may not have the time or opportunity to get enough by whenever in December this happens.

My favorites where Reshiram in black and Zekrom in white, Ditto had also a very nice green on him. Unfortunately I cannot do screenshots on the gameplay but I do also highly recommend you to take a look on the different colors of shiny and not shiny Pok√©mon. Some are really good, I don‚Äôt know if this is illegal to the Pok√©mon community or already have been posted here before.

"Hey, 

Please do not just vent on me. This whole post is my own opinion and story. I don't think I like the new level cap. Okay, maybe it is cool but hear me out. I am worried this might result in me not enjoying this game as much anymore. 

After reaching level 40 somewhere in 2018 (pre friendship era) I really began enjoying this game. Collecting things, powering up pokemon and doing raids. The grind to lvl 40 always seemed a bit stressed to me. Always needing to think and stress about lucky eggs and xp grinding. I remember the grind not being fun at all. 

After I hit lvl 40 the game really did really open for me. The game went to a kind of relaxed environmental. Never having to stress about getting xp or activating lucky eggs. Since this point I really started enjoying this game. Just no grind, no stress and me relaxing when collecting pokemon and battle raids and gyms.

Now the level cap will be increased to lvl 50. This worries me. I do not see my lvl 40 grind as any fun. The tasks are fine tho! But the xp grind sounds horrible... I have read you need 176M xp for lvl 50.... atm I have 102M xp so I have to get 74M xp more....

I am not looking forward to the lvl50 grind at all. The tasks are absolutely fine and I got no problem with those. However, the xp grind is so long, boring and stressfull.",Maybe I do not really look forward to the new lvl50 cap,pokemongo
"Since AR mapping tasks were introduced, my partner and I have noticed something very weird about our rewards: while he usually gets either the pokemon (always skarmory), the poffin or sometimes 10 pokeballs, I always get 3 hyper potions, 3 revives or 5 ultras.

At the beginning we though it was only bad RNG but everyday it‚Äôs getting weirder, because we spin the same pokestops and keep getting the same rewards over and over again. 

Is it that bad of a RNG? Is this some kind of trial with some players (for example to see if better rewards trigger more players doing AR tasks) like the beginning of the first pokemon of the day and the daily present? Or do I have to enable something apart from the pokestop scan option from settings to get better rewards?

I'm currently on almost 5 Million EXP total and require approximately 15.5 Million EXP to reach Level 40. First of all, I've done the maths and it's doable. It just takes a little bit of planning and meticulous play. I cleared my friends list and started again.

Is anyone really fooled here? Taking on every Blissey-Togekiss-Chansey-Snorlax gym with an Aggron or Hex Gengar that faints within a single Dazzling Gleam is endearing, sure. Tedious in the spirit of 'GO-ing' but nothing a quick creature swap won't fix.

**A CP438 Skarmory and an unevolved Geodude.** Let me reiterate, this is what the game's formula believes is most suited for the task. Any of the 2500+ much more powerful mons in *anyone's* storage would be more suited. For example; Fighting type + 1 Counter = Fainted Ditto before it even transforms. Skarmory and Geodude wouldn't get much done once the Ditto transforms either.

"*This is without best friend grinding. Which you could factor in on top of this.* 

*Also remember this is under ideal situations, I'd say that you prob get an average of 8 people joining raids but you can always re-try to minimize additional costs.*

**Semi-FTP version.**
Single lucky eggs plus free raid pass. Assuming you have lucky eggs stored up or gold from gyms saved up this is free. Go to the /r/PokemonGoFriends subreddit and post in the raids thread. Host 5* raid and add 10 people. Finish raid.

10* 6000xp (double egg plus new friends) = 60k xp plus 20k (30k right now with bonus but I'll ignore this) so the raid gives you an instant 80k xp. Over the course of a month this is **2.4 MILLION XP** without best friends and other xp you are obtaining.

**Paid Version:**
If you do this 3x a day. As you can prob run 3 raids in 30 minutes under ideal circumstances or you just use more eggs because you are already spending money. So you buy the box with the passes (currently would be **approx $50** for 16x4 passes which gets you to the 60 required). That is 240k xp per day. That's **7.2 million xp.** Which is all of lvl 39 and half of 38. At a 1.5 hour daily requirement.

So you said screw it I will play at least 3 hours and dump $100 in a month to max out. That brings you to **14.4 million xp** without any best friend or other bonuses that you will likely throw in there.

*Remember there is more than a month left. Extrapolate that and you essentially have the entire lvl 1-40 for $120?*

**Other stuff:**
Things to note. To invite 10 people to a raid you need to invite 5, wait until just before 60 seconds or so for everyone to enter. Leave and come back and invite 5 new ones. Demand is high right now, you get 40+ invites nearly instantaneously as there is higher demand than supply for raids right now. If more people do this then the xp slows. Also remember you need NEW friends for this so the more you do the less likely you get new people. At the moment there is plenty of new people. Could dry up because honestly never thought of doing this for real. 

Also rural players. Prob cannot consistently get enough raids to invite to do this. Prob gonna need a car so factor in gas and all of that. 

A final consideration and advice. This gets slowed down because you gotta delete friends to add new ones. In addition to this you can't decline friends to make this faster because PokemonGo still thinks you want to block them forever when you do this. So you gotta add people then delete.

**Tldr;** You can go from lvl 1-40 before end of December spending like $120. Free to play people 2.4M xp which is half of 39. Without factoring in best friend xp and EVERYTHING ELSE.",How you could theoretically get to lvl 40 in time,pokemongo

"As an avid PvP player, I have spent millions of stardust on certain Pok√©mon to perform well in the great league and ultra league. Master league isn‚Äôt really a concern, because the best IVs you can get doesn‚Äôt change. But for great league and ultra league, things change for certain Pok√©mon. 

Take for instance my 100% Medicham. I spent a good 300k dust on this Pok√©mon alone. It was the best one I could get for great league, as it maxed out at 1431 without the best buddy boost. Now, it‚Äôs not the best one and it won‚Äôt even really be all that good compared to the new rank one coming out that will replace it. Lots of other Pok√©mon that I‚Äôve been slowly preparing for great and ultra league are all of a sudden not as viable as they once were. 

I wish that the level up system just applied to the trainers and not the Pok√©mon, because it seems kinda BS that I now have to spend even MORE stardust if I want to be as competitive as I can be. Because at the higher ranks in GBL, every bit of edge matters. 

I understand that for someone not so into PvP that this is probably exciting and not a big deal, but I feel like PvP players just got screwed big time.

"Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of friendship gains and xp gains. Sorry if the formatting sucks, I‚Äôm on mobile.

Good friends - 1 day -     3000 xp

Great friends - 7 days -   10,000 xp

Ultra friends -  30 days - 50,000 xp

Best friends -  90 days - 100,000 xp

Ok, so there‚Äôs not enough time to add a friend and make Best Friends by Dec 31. You can do your own math to add those friends you have that can reach Best Friends by that date.

Doing some quick math, Ultra friends in 30 days gets you 63,000 xp per friend. For a quick reference, it will take about 16 friends 30 days to reach 1,000,000 xp.

Lvl 39 to 40 takes 5,000,000 xp. At 63,000 xp per friend, that will take just over 79 friends to go from lvl 39 to 40 in 30 days (not including xp from other sources).

For me, at about 1 mil xp into lvl 38, I need about 7 mil xp until lvl 40. That would take just over 111 friend going from new to ultra friends in 30 days.",Friendship xp breakdown,pokemongo

"I have long wondered why Niantic implemented XP gain and Pokemon leveling the way that they did. Why does catching a level 35 Pokemon yield the same XP as catching a level 1 Pokemon, when catching that level 35 Pokemon is *SIGNIFICANTLY* more difficult? Now, I understand that there are far too many Pokemon to give each one their own Base XP gains, but how hard could it have been to have a sliding scale based upon the Pokemon's level? A level 1-5 Pokemon gives 50, 6-10 gives 100, 11-15 gives 150, and so on. That seems fair. It also further incentivizes leveling up.

The next complaint I have is in regards to how Pokemon level up and obtain moves. Why aren't new moves unlocked via level up, just like every other Pokemon game in existence? To me, if you are putting in the effort, Stardust, and candy to max out a Pokemon, you should get to FREELY choose which moves it has. Yes, you should still have to use TMs to teach moves that a Pokemon wouldn't otherwise learn. However, if a Pokemon learns a move via level up, it should also learn that move in Pokemon GO.

What does everyone think?",Thoughts on obtaining and leveling up Pokemon in Pokemon GO.,pokemongo

"The breakdown:


* Hitting certain tiers of friends awards exp, the ""best"" of these being Ultra or Best friend.


* The idea is that you want to group a bunch of people, work them to those tiers, then save them at 1 interaction before rolling over to those tiers.


* Then you pop your lucky egg and open all their gifs for massive exp gains.




The problem:


* Because of the lucrative exp gains at those tiers, along with how the friendship system is not at all sync'd, the risk of getting removed off the other player's friend list after they get their exp but before you get yours is high.





The solution:



* Don't rely solely on Ultra/Best friend exp tiers.






The TLDR best method:



* Add a bunch of people at random, doesn't matter where.


* Work them up to 1 day prior to Great Friends (the 7 day interaction).


* Pop lucky egg and open.





The math:




* At 10k per friend without a lucky egg or 20k with, 10 players opened at Great Friend without the egg is 100k exp, the same that you would get from Ultra Friend if you used a Lucky Egg. 5 players getting the same amount if using a Lucky Egg.


* If for example we added 30 friends, and worked them to Great Friend then opened their gifts with a Lucky Egg, that's 600k exp for 7 days of work, compared to the same exp from 6 Ultra Friends in exchange for 30 days of work.








________

Basically go for the shorter bursts of exp with a quantity over quality mindset, they're easier to achieve due to the low risk of getting removed from the friends list early while also not stinging as bad if they delete you early, as you would have done less than a week of work compared to roughly a month of work going down the drain.","Your ""best"" bet to hit Lv40, a TLDR on friendship exp.",pokemongo

"I got three ideas that I think it would be nice to have in the game:

The first one is the possibility to battle the wild pokemon, for example in the anime, the trainers battle against the wild pokemon to let him weaker, on the game this could work like a pvp, except it doesn‚Äôt have a trainer behind the pokemon, and this could be a option, like, when you touch the pokemon a notification would pop and say ‚Äúdo you wish to weak the pokemon?‚Äù and you select yes or no, this way we could capture higher cp pokemon on the wild and reduce the chance of it escaping when we don‚Äôt have ultra or great balls. But I am still sorting some other details.

The second idea is having PokeCenters, for those who don‚Äôt know, the PokeCenters work as a hospital for pokemon, this would be some cool feature, on the game PokeCenters could places you let your pokemon to fully heal after 20min for example after a raid you can find a poke center, just like you find and select a pokeStop, but obviously we would have less pokeCenters than pokeStops, and after the pokemon is healed he return to your inventory just like when a pokemon is knocked off the gym.

This ideas are things that me and my friends though would be nice, and they are more focused to the players that doesn‚Äôt have stops near them.

This next idea is more of a bonus, we didn‚Äôt all like it but I am going to comment either way, add a new hole system of coins, not like the normal golden coins, they would be secondary coins that we would acquire by completing tasks, winning raids and acquiring medals, and we would be able to access shops which we can buy all itens separately, for example we gain 200 coins for completing a legendary raid, and 1 hyper potion is 50 coins for example, but would only be able to buy itens such as potions, revive crystals, and TMs for example.

"So I thought I'd for once have some effort.

Stacked pokeballs and berries, bought more pokemon storage, made sure my buddy was able to catch assist, even bought and cracked a lucky egg too. Ready for an intense poke session. And then, without thinking, since it was raining and dark and cold, opened an incense too at 17:55.

I didn't know. Should have thought about it tho. When I tried to open my mystery box, no can do, another incense puffing there already. I'm a fukken massive 4\* idiot. What should have been a pokemon sesh with so much meltans and meltan candy and meltan shinies was just like that Pablo Escobar waiting meme, plus meowths spawning everywhere like crazy.

Not use for them. Had like 500 candies already. Surely I could get some Lileep or Slowpoke or idk if I just walked a bit? Off to the rain. No, meowths  meowths everywhere, another meme appropriate here. Plus I was cold wet and phone's battery started rapidly get lower.

At least I'll have that five minutes I hurried away? So waiting those, catching those meowths since maybe a shiny? At home now, on the sofa, pabloescobarwaiting. Well, the time came, my box worked, but had only two Meltans with the sweet double/triple candies... I sat on my ass for 30min and had another walk for the last 30 although already soaked and cold. Saldo: 38 meltans, not one shiny, no 4\*s or even 3\*s. But definitely walking makes more spawning, not the way like those cursed meowths but more.

I'm sure it would be an extremely small change overall, but it would make me as a player feel far less wasteful about trashing items and would add a little more motivation to spin stops just to get 2 or 3 basic pokeballs.","Item exchange, quality of life improvement",pokemongo

"For beginners, I don‚Äôt have the meta all mapped out and there are better sites for that, but just in general here are some tips I‚Äôd recommend considering:

-Everyone is using fairy‚Äôs to counteract Dragonaire. Remember fairy is weak to steel and poison. Steel is weak to fighting and fire which a lot of people use in the form of Machamp and Alolan MAROWAK. 

-Alolan MAROWAK is all over the meta again (just like Halloween). I, personally, have been using Golem against him. MAROWAK charges fast and golems rock throw can almost keep up. But he‚Äôs ghost and fire so use whatever you want. 

-Lapras and Snorlax are the ‚Äúgo to tanks.‚Äù Snorlax actually takes decent damage from Beedrill. So you can combine that with the first thing I said for your consideration. Lapras can be taken down by Electric and grass but remember, Lapras typically has ice attacks so grass probably isn‚Äôt good. Alolan Raichu is electric and psychic and charges fast so he could be good for Lapras and the above Machamp. 

-Other common Pok√©mon I‚Äôve seen so far: Wigglytuff, Beedrill, and Hypno. 

By no means am I an expert. I place 9-10 every league, average 20 wins out of 25 matches and am rank 10 now. So I‚Äôm not some pro but I‚Äôm not completely clueless either.

"Hatching eggs in the game is a great way to get great pokemon but the system could use some improvements, so here are some ideas that I think would help a lot

&amp;#x200B;

Deleting eggs- It's so often that you get eggs you don't want so I think it would be nice to have the ability to discard like 3-5 eggs a day to balance it. This would also help when you have full egg slots but there are event eggs out.

&amp;#x200B;

A second permanent egg incubator when you reach level 40, or the ability to buy a second permanent incubator once you reach a certain level, also maybe adjusting the cost of incubators because they are a bit expensive for only 3 uses.

&amp;#x200B;

The ability to upgrade your permanent incubator to a permanent super incubator as a reward for a special questline or a purchase in the shop similar to a bag upgrade, would probably cost around 1000 poke-coins.

"So I dunno about you lot, but I'm carrying loads of dead weight Pokemon at the moment waiting for a chance to TM away Frustration, if not having to bite the bullet and use them with the crappiest of all charge moves (still &lt;3 you Little Cup Shadow Stunky, you little bitey monster).

We have no idea when we'll be able to next TM it away. We usually only get a week's notice, which is barely enough to plan anything, especially if a Pokemon isn't in Rocket rotation at that point. We're getting things like Catch Cup, where we can't adequately prepare any Shadow mons, and I'm not much inclined to spend gobs of stardust just to get one useable move on a Pokemon I'll use for a week.

And most frustrating of all right now, we have three Fighting legendaries in T5s, we all have a Shadow Mewtwo, and we can't bloomin' use it.

It's kinda stupid that they ever restrict it at all--just weaponising FOMO against us--but if they allowed Elite TMs to always change it, that's still far from a free for all, and would mostly be used to make Shadow legendaries immediately useable IMHO, because no-one is going to waste an ECTM on a new Shadow Victreebel for the sake of one week. (At least, no-one sensible.) It'd be a compromise, instead of us all sat here twiddling our thumbs wondering if it'll be June before we can use our Shadow Mewtwos without sinking 120 RC in to unlock the second move.

I've played this game religiously since launch in [Third World country], and I never once had any other people play with me outside the time everyone did while it was still a fad.

In all these years, I've played alone, raided alone (up to 3 stars, but never more), and only had legendaries from research breakthroughs.

I've received gifts from time to time from friends who probably got bored in life, and visited the game for a fleeting moment before disappearing once again.

My buddy, a Porygon I caught in a chance trip to Singapore (which I named 'Changi' in honor of that INCREDIBLE airport I caught him in), has kept me company at least for the time being. (I probably should have fed him before taking this screenshot lol)

People who live the ""true"" Pokemon Go life - spinning thousands of stops in a vibrant, saturated map with countless module flowers dropping like a Japanese sakura field, and raiding and trading with other real-life people - I want to know your story.

"I get that in the early days of Pok√©mon Go, Niantic was just dipping their toes into how Pok√©mon evolve. However, now that Niantic has implemented a bunch of new evolution mechanics, I think it‚Äôs time Eevee‚Äôs original 3 evolutions got revisited.

Firstly, I think it would be okay to keep the random evolution option, but I think it would also be nice to have other options for choosing which version to evolve into. Sticking to the more recent evolution stones Niantic has been using. I suggest adding a ‚ÄúKanto Stone‚Äù. 

This stone could be used as an optional evolution mechanic for Gen 1 Pok√©mon that required a stone in the games, but also still have the original evolution options available. The insensitive to use the stone would be that it cost much less candy when evolving those Pok√©mon, similar to how trade evolutions where retroactively added to Gen 1 Pok√©mon.

For Eevee, all the option to pick which of the three Pok√©mon to evolve into when using the stone, but as I said earlier, also keep the option to randomly evolve it for just 25 candy (this way, you still stay true to their original design).

Not much else to say. They‚Äôve been adding a bunch of evolution mechanics, and I think now is a better time than any for them to revisit their early design chooses and relook at them now that they have a more robust system.

Edit: After reading some comments, I realize my suggestion is not perfect and there are potentially other better options. Nonetheless, I still feel strongly they should do something about the current state of Eevee‚Äôs original 3 evolutions.

"so when im out of pokeballs do i just take a week off and just focus on poke stops,gifts and maybe raids because even tho the game gives you actually a large amount of free pokeballs you need to walk at least 10km (in my case) to farm up a decent amount of pokeballs and the game knows that so ofcourse it gives you the chance to buy pokeballs but its such a small amount that you can use them all in one day if you want to grind a certain pokemon,and if you dont buy you are left with the only way and its to walk all day for 50 pokeballs before you collapse and break your neck but it also slows down the progress so much which forces you to use money,and also raids man 250 points for 3 passes ok fine but lets say you buy 3 passes daily its 21 a week and not everyone can buy so the people that only get free raid pass have such a small chance to catch the boss pokemon and if they fail gg see ya next week

im sorry if this turned from question to rant but its a fact,and its fine they have to earn money aswell but at least give 50 pokeballs weekly or 1 pass every day or something because progress is too slow without paying

this is not a post to bash on the game the fact that it gives you so much free stuff is amazing,but not everyone have 20 pokestops in 1 km raius,not everyone can walk 10-15km for 50 pokeballs that they will use the same day,not everyone can pay,PROGRESS TO SLOW

At wits end here. Have been a Gotcha owner for some time. Been using it for an old phone I use for Pokemon Go -- a Note 4. 

It's strange. The phone seems to have no issue for months. Turn on bluetooth, press Gotcha, it connects. Some other months, it's TERRIBLE. After the last Pokemon Go update, my Gotcha is back to being insufferably bad with the phone.

I've been trying to pair it for the better part of 2 hours. After clearing bluetooth cache, unpairing it, toggling bluetooth -- it just refuses to reliably connect.

I got it to pair exactly once this morning. But after 50+ connect attempts again, it won't work.

It shows up in the list of devices. It shows it flashing green in the center when I tap on it-- but when it tries to negotiate, it spins over and over and over until it inevitably times out. Nothing I can do can force a connection. 

I've google searched all troubleshooting tips for the past 4 years and NOTHING helps.

"I didn't have the greatest amount of pokeballs going into this event but thts on me, it did however create a problem later.    

To start I went to check for a event ticket, seeing it was only $0.99 I grabbed it using my opinion reward money. I found the rewards to be honestly bad: 10 pinap berries and next set asks you to use 15, that's not how you reward, at all. Then 2 quests give you 50 candies for a total of 100 candies sounds awesome but then they ask you to evolve a Electabuzz, thts 100 candies and your reward? 2 golden razz.
To add to this it was pretty annoying to see tht electabuzz is only 3 candies not 5 like a 2nd evo should be. It should have been a elekid event if they wanted to give out 3 candies per, and to make it worse electavire is only 5 instead of 10. Thts a lot of jipped candy imo.    

While most of this is very frustrating to me, it honestly isnt as big a deal as I'm making it sound. But to end off my experience, I only had 1 ultra ball left when I happened to click on a shiny. A great curveball throw, with a silver pinap, gold medal for electrics and it popped out. Very annoying, but sh*t happens. I went to purchase pokeballs, again with rewards money, and the game got stuck on a loading symbol, after 5 full min I restarted and the shiny was gone.    

I hate to come on here and just complain but I was looking forward to this event. I like electabuzz and electrivire is probably the only sinnoh added evo I enjoy. But the whole experience left me feeling kind of annoyed. Sorry to come in here and vent but for some reason I felt the need to announce my displeasure somewhere; that isn't what it's like to be a Karen is it? Oh no...

"So it's only been 1.5 hours into CD here but I just have to rant.

If you see my previous reviews, I still say it was good no matter how lackluster it can be. So the fact that my tone change for this review should say something.

Generally bad CD. Electabuzz is hard to catch, full stop. You can have golden electric badge throwing excellent ultracurveball throw with golden razzberry to a below CP 1k Electabuzz and it still will break, not exaggerating.

Electabuzz jumps a lot and if you don't use razzberry, it's way likely to break out.

I'm not saying that Niantic should spread their legs, put on a silver platter and let everything be a one throw catch but this is way too annoying.

We've seen before that Niantic had adjusted the rate for starters and Abra as well as Rhyhorn distance to make CD more easier for people. I seen in a different post that Electabuzz's rate did changed but doesn't seem so.

I've been hoarding pinap berry whole week with the intention to use it today and razzberry those with high CP but trust me, even lowish CP need razzberry.

I don't like to hatch stuff during CD so I can't say whether Elekid/2km egg rate are up.

Regardless, I got 4 shiny and Shadow Electivire with Flamethrower so I'm just going to do shiny check after this.

In short, if it ain't broken, don't fix it. And hopefully Magmar's CD will be better.",My Electabuzz CD experience,pokemongo

March. Aries- ram and sheep Pok√©mon are boosted with the release of shiny cottonee

April. Taurus- Tauros, Miltank, and Bouffalant etc are boosted with the release of shiny miltank or bouffalant

May. Gemini- Pok√©mon w visible counterparts are boosted (minun &amp; plusle, volbeat &amp; illumise, shellos etc.) w the release of shiny shellos 

June. Cancer- crab Pok√©mon boosted (dwebble, paras, krabby, etc.) with the release of shiny paras

July. Leo- cat Pok√©mon are boosted (meowth, purrloin, skitty, etc.) with the release of shiny purrloin

August. Virgo- female Pok√©mon are boosted (chansey, jynx, kangaskhan, nidoran, etc.) with the release of shiny petilil 

September. Libra- Pok√©mon with non visible counterparts are boosted (electabuzz &amp; magmar, hitmonlee &amp; hitmonchan, seviper &amp; zangoose, etc.) with the release of shiny tyrogue (to evolve up to hitmonchan, hitmonlee, and hitmontop) 

October. Scorpio- Bug Pok√©mon boosted (skorupi, spinarak, joltik, etc.) with the release of shiny spinarak

November. Sagittarius- fighting types are boosted( pawniard, etc.) with the release of shiny pawniard (kind of a stretch I know)

"As most veteran players know, and many new/returning players may have learned from asking about specific Pokemon, we're coming up on what is usually a special event for Pokemon Go. In both 2018 and 2019, instead of featuring an individual Pokemon for Community Day in December, Niantic has held special Community Day weekends which featured spawns (or egg hatches or raids) of **all** Pokemon that previously had a Community Day, and, more importantly, they could all be evolved to obtain their exclusive Community Day moves, some of which are incredibly useful to the point of necessity. This post is to help people (veteran and new players alike) decide which Pokemon to hold out for and which to evolve without care. 

###Note: Niantic has not announced a December Community Day event and if one does happen, we do not know for sure if it will operate similar to past years. This is the first year that Elite TMs have existed, and it remains to be seen if and how those will impact the availability of exclusive moves. This post is making the assumption that **ALL** prior Community Day Pokemon will be able to get their exclusive moves.

The following table lists all prior Community Day Pokemon, their exclusive move(s), and a *brief* analysis of the move's importance in both raids and PvP. There is obviously more nuance to some of these than this format can properly address, but it serves to give a general overview. After the table, I've included some frequently asked questions.

|Pokemon|Move|Raids|PvP|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Pikachu|Surf|You don't use Pikachu in raids|On the off-chance Pikachu is ever used in some kind of special cup, a coverage move like Surf could be a nice surprise, but not necessary|
|Dratini|Draco Meteor|Not necessary, a two-bar move like Outrage is generally better in raids|There's an argument for running Draco Meteor in PvP, but I think Outrage or Hurricane are better second charged moves|
|Bulbasaur|Frenzy Plant|Necessary|Necessary|
|Mareep|Dragon Pulse|Not necessary. Ampharos becomes part Dragon when Mega Evolved, but there are much better options|Interesting coverage move in PvP, especially in Ultra Premier where it can avoid being completely walled by Venusaur. Not necessary, but can be useful|
|Charizard|Blast Burn|Necessary.|Overheat can work but Blast Burn is strictly better.|
|Charizard|Dragon Breath|Not necessary. Even as Mega Charizard X, it's outclassed by many other Dragons in raids|Not necessary, but could be useful in niche situations like Silph Cups and has play in open Ultra League. Could be worth getting one.|
|Larvitar|Smack Down|Necessary if you want to use it as a Rock attacker. Tyranitar is still useable as a Dark attacker though|Great League Tyranitar usually wants to have Smack Down, but in Master League it's usually run as a shadow with Bite.|
|Squirtle|Hydro Cannon|Necessary.|Necessary.|
|Eevee|Last Resort|Not necessary or desired.|Necessary for Umbreon for Great League. Useful for other Eeveelutions as a coverage move in PvP, but none of them are quite as useful as Umbreon|
|Chikorita|Frenzy Plant|Necessary (but Meganium isn't that great in raids in the first place).|Necessary.
|Beldum|Meteor Mash|Necessary.|Necessary.|
|Cyndaquil|Blast Burn|Necessary (like Meganium, Typhlosion isn't that great in raids though).|Necessary.|
|Totodile|Hydro Cannon|Necessary.|Necessary.|
|Swinub|Ancient Power|Not Necessary|Mamoswine usually runs Avalanche/Bulldoze, so not really needed.|
|Treecko|Frenzy Plant|Necessary.|Not necessary. Leaf Blade is a great move and arguably preferable to Frenzy Plant.|
|Bagon|Outrage|Not completely necessary, but a definite improvement over Draco Meteor.|Salamence really has no play in PvP, but if you *were* going to use it, you'd want Outrage.|
|Torchic|Blast Burn|Necessary.|Not 100% necessary. Blaziken can run alternate movesets with Blaze Kick + Overheat/Brave Bird/Stone Edge.|
|Slakoth|Body Slam|Not necessary.|Not necessary.|
|Ralts|Synchronoise||Not necessary.|Not necessary. It's a decent second move for Gardevoir, but it's really going to use Shadow Ball 99% of the time.|
|Turtwig|Frenzy Plant|Necessary.|Pretty necessary, but it can technically be viable without it by running Razor Leaf/Sand Tomb/Stone Edge|
|Trapinch|Earth Power|Not necessary.|Necessary.|
|Chimchar|Blast Burn|Infernape isn't that useful in general, but to the extent it gets used at all, it's going to need Blast Burn.|Same is true for PvP as for raids.|
|Piplup|Hydro Cannon|Necessary.|Necessary.|
|Rhyhorn|Rock Wrecker|Huge improvement for use as a Rock attacker, but not *strictly* neccessary.| Very useful in PvP, but other movesets are viable.|
|Abra|Counter|Not necessary or even desired.|Makes it better for PvP but honestly it's still not that great.|
|Seedot|Bullet Seed|Shiftry isn't really relevant in raids.|Shiftry probably wants Snarl 9/10 times|
|Weedle|Drill Run|Not necessary or desired.|Big improvement for PvP. Can get by without it, but definitely prefers it.|
|Gastly|Shadow Punch|Not necessary.|Pretty necessary for Gengar in PvP, but note that Haunter gets Shadow Punch normally and plays pretty similarly (in Great League at least), though glassier.|
|Magikarp|Aqua Tail|Not necessary.|Not 100% necessary, but a nice bait move with STAB for PvP|
|Porygon|Tri-Attack|Porygon-Z isn't that useful for raids.|Tri-Attack is a good move, and if you're going to run Porygon-Z you want to have it, but it's still a pretty niche pick and the best moveset is Return/Tri-Attack which requires an Elite TM because evolving would replace Return with Tri-Attack.|
|Electabuzz|Flamethrower|Not necessary or desired.|Not necessary or desired.|
|Magmortar|Thunderbolt|Not necessary or desired.|Magmortar still isn't that useful in PvP, but Thunderbolt makes it a tiny bit better.|

###FAQ

Note: Answers to these questions are based on how the event operated in 2018 and 2019. No details about a potential 2020 December Community Day have been announced.

1. Can I get these moves with a TM?

No, the moves can only be obtained by *evolving to the Pokemon's final form* (except for Pikachu, which *loses* its Community Day move when evolving).

2. Can I get these moves by unlocking a second charged move on an already evolved Pokemon?

No, the moves can only be obtained by *evolving to the Pokemon's final form* (except for Pikachu, which *loses* its Community Day move when evolving).

3. Can I evolve at any time during the entire weekend for these moves?

In 2019, Pokemon could be evolved for their exclusive moves during specifically announced time windows each day of the Community Day weekend, and evolving outside those specified times would result in not receiving the move.

4. Can I get these moves on my shadow Pokemon?

No. If a Pokemon's Community Day move is a charged move, a shadow version of that Pokemon can only get the Community Day move if Frustration was removed during a prior event which allowed it. Community Day charged moves can *only* go in the first charged move slot (except when using an Elite TM) and *cannot* override Frustration. If the Pokemon's Community Day move is a fast move, then Frustration will not interfere and it can get the Community Day move regardless.

5. Can I get these moves on my purified Pokemon?

Yes! Purified Pokemon, even if they have Return, can learn their Community Day moves upon evolution. Note that because Return is in the first charged move slot and because Community Day charged moves must go in the first charged move slot, the only way to get a Pokemon with both Return *and* its Community Day charged move would be to evolve it *outside* the timeframe for the exclusive move and use an Elite TM to get the Community Day move in the second charged move slot.",December Community Day Quick Guide,pokemongo

"Hey everyone,

For a little background, I got my son into Pokemon Go when the quarantine started.  We would drive/walk around and he would catch Pokemon and get supplies at stops.  I didn't know anything about gyms, raids, the Battle League, and so on but we would battle Team Rocket.  Every time we battled a leader, we would get destroyed by their Tyranitar so he wanted one of his own.

He had a Larvitar so after a lot of walking, catching or hatching the one-off Larvitars, he was able to evolve it to Pupitar.  I think it had a CP of 1600 so I expected the evolved Tyranitar to be 2400+.  So I continued to walk with it as a buddy for about 4 weeks at work, during lunch, and on the weekends to get more candies.  I then joined the Battle League and discovered that I can earn candies there as well.  So finally last night, I got 100 Larvitar candies.  This morning, I had my son evolve Pupitar to Tyranitar.  We were both excited but then it's CP was only 1626.  Did we get jipped or is that normal/expected?  He didn't care but I was confused.  I expected it to be one of his highest CP and strongest Pokemons.

"I know many others who have this same gripe, but I haven't seen a thread about it here yet, and it should be called out.

When I'm catching in a hurry, I flag stuff with a ""?"" to look at later. Search for ""?"", they all show up. Business as usual.

Once I check it, I want to compare it to the others of that mon I already have. This means searching for that name, instead, which means deleting the question mark. 

Before the update, that was no problem; just backspace and type the name (I do ""+"" and the name, to view all in that family.) 

Now, whenever you empty the search bar, it drops out of it, and you have to open it again. After I finish with that mon, I have to clear the bar and search ""?"" again to see what's next. That means the bar drops yet again, and I have to reopen it.

""Just sort by name, drangus!"" I hear you say.

I already do, and I use a ""#"" for my 20 buddies so they're at the top for easy daily swapping to build buddy hearts with them. 

""Okay, then just use a ""(quotation mark)"" for your new catches, so they appear above that, and make sure to clear them all out every day before you swap buddies again.""

Don't you tell me how to live my life, Mom! This game already has enough daily tasks, stop making this even more of a chore.

It's a small thing, but it adds up and makes organizing my mons considerably more tedious and time consuming.  

It's also redundant. If you want to get out of the search bar, you've always been able just to hit the Back button. There's no reason for emptying the search bar to do that.

For me, and doubtless for many of you, it's a definite QoL downgrade with a simple fix which needs to be called out.

"I put away my charged TMs in 2018 when I evolved my buddy ASAP, and I dealt with the fact that he was never gonna get to learn blast burn. I'm staring down my one (1) elite tm, coping with the fact that all of those pokemon i caught early and evolved ASAP (all those rhyperiors i evolved to beat giovanni, my first alakazam, etc.) have inefficient and suboptimal moves.

For a game that loves to use FOMO to make you spend money on the game, PoGo sure does love to give you FOMO for playing the game at all. ""Oops! You threw out that 0/14/15 swablu because you thought it was worthless and gbl didnt exist yet!"" ""Oops! You pumped all your candies into POOPY MEWTWO instead of GOOD MEWTWO."" ""Oops! You dumped a bunch of stardust on your 96% pokemon and then caught a hundo!"" ""Oops! You purified a shadow pokemon because they were bad, but now they're good, tough luck!""

The conciliatory effort to give people Elite TMs as an option for missing out falls flat on its surface. It's not even a suggestion at this point to say it could be massively improved - it never should have been designed this way. WHY do TMs work the way they do? Was it impossible for them to let you pick from a list? Why are some (not even legacy/event) moves strictly better than others? Why can't you increase IVs? The game is about tapping your screen repeatedly; there is no strategic depth besides type matchups, and that's **perfectly fine.** The only thing that is accomplished by this gambling system is increased frustration. I don't even feel good about getting the ""right"" moves, I just feel relieved that I don't have to play the guessing game anymore.

The overall effect of these fun, fomo events is not that I get excited about all the new stuff I can collect. Instead, I feel punished for playing the game. It's like the opposite of collector's anxiety (where people with exclusive content feel cheated when that content appears again). My exclusive content (magmortar i caught in 2016) is now out of date, and there's NO way for me to update it.

I can't even tell what Niantic's ideal way to play the game even is anymore. Is it playing the game on community day only, and never evolving or powering up anything until its exclusive move arrives (as I've started doing, because I am now paranoid)? Is it throwing out all your old garbage every time there's something better that comes along? I have held my tongue for years now, but the system has gotten so out of control that I simply can't keep it to myself anymore. This is not fun, and we need to make sure that Niantic KNOWS that it's not fun, because I'm getting the feeling they think we're having a great time with these awful, frustrating systems.","The more community days happen, the less I like the exclusive move system",pokemongo

"I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts lately requesting an option to ‚Äúdelete‚Äù undesirable eggs. 

We players would love that, but Niantic is not incentivized to implement it, since it would break their Skinner Box and reduce incubator profits. 

That said, their current model sucks. I haven‚Äôt played the game in 2 days, because I have an open hatch spot, a Rocket Radar, and haven‚Äôt wanted the spot to fill with some random 5k egg when I can get a fun 12k instead. So I can‚Äôt open the app until I have time to pull out my laptop and look up guides on the best counter-Pokemon for the Rocket boss I need to fight.  

I‚Äôve encountered other variants of this issue. Such as wanting to avoid 7k eggs because the pool is bad, but needing more pokeballs &amp; not having access to a pokestop. Guess I should close the app; find something else to do while I‚Äôm stuck in line.   
Or, never getting the weekly egg reward despite walking the necessary mileage, because it‚Äôs too difficult to coordinate hatching an egg and then logging off &amp; not playing until the week rolls over. 

I look after some backyard chickens, and caring for them gave me a great idea for how to solve the problem of getting unwanted eggs, or not being able to play because you‚Äôre trying to save an egg spot for a specific type of egg. 

Chickens often have ‚ÄòDummy Eggs‚Äô, aka ping pong balls, placed into their nests. The presence of Dummy Eggs encourages chickens to increase egg production. It also gives the chicken something eggy to brood over while the true eggs are collected. 

Pokemon Go should introduce a fake, placeholder egg. It stays in your item bag and when you have a free egg slot, you can pop it into that empty spot as a filler. While the Dummy Egg is filling one of the 9 slots, that slot can‚Äôt get filled by any real eggs you may encounter spinning stops, opening gifts, etc. Then, when you‚Äôre ready to add a new egg - be it 7k, 12k, weekly rewards, community day eggs, and more - you can put the Dummy Egg back into your bag and free up the slot for a real egg. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Fake egg you can manually put in as a placeholder until you're ready to fill that egg slot. 

What do you think? If you have any thoughts on how to implement a ""Dummy Egg"" system, or ideas for some other system, I'd love to hear it!

"I really like remote raid passes. They are one of the best things to happen to the game. I rolled over out of bed the other day from the west coast of the U.S. and received a raid invite from one of my PoGo friends in Germany who wanted help raiding in the Hessen region. Not a bad way to start the day. I also like that I can nab a quick raid during breaks at work without leaving the building. While good, the remote raid passes could use two, maybe three upgrades to them.

* Friends status - Right now we have the option to appear online when playing. It doesn't do much good. What it should do is give us the option to set a ""looking for raid"" status with the levels we want to do. Then if a friend is out raiding or sees one remotely at the level we want, they can see on their friends list who wants to join. If they do join a 5 star raid, the friends that are looking for raids are automatically invited, though the friends still have to  accept the invite first. PoGo does not have a messenger system to talk to friends and meet up. This would help with communication while also keeping the game kid friendly.

* Wait for X players - Right now if Im remotely raiding and theres no one in the lobby I can test the waters via joining the lobby as the raid pass isn't used until the battle starts. Sometimes I can get 3 people to join when I need 5 to do a 5 star raid. That means backing out with 10-15 seconds left, waiting, then rejoining to recreate the lobby. Instead players should be able to pause the start timer, or restart it, until X number of players join. Nothing insane like 10 players for a 1 star raid but something reasonable like 2 players for a 1 star raid (newbs need help too), 3 for a 3 star, and 5 players for a 5 star raid.

* Queue up option - Instead of waiting in the lobby for others to join, players should be able to tag the gym as ""interested"" in raiding. This would be similar to the lobby except that players would still be free to browse other gyms and if enough players tag a raid as ""interested"" they all get invited to go. Players could tag 2 or 3 raids as ""interested"" and still collect pokemon around them or spin stops while they wait, rather then sitting there staring at the same screen doing nothing.

"Thought i should make this post since niantic opened up nominations to level 38 and above players! 

1. The basics: check what is a wayfarer spot!
- to avoid disappointment do not nominate live plants /pets! Or places within your residential property (No! You can't have a pokestop within your house!)
- do not nominate schools: nursery/primary /secondary (high-school)! You can nominate college campuses!!
2. Always check YOUR LOCATION of the spot
- if wayfarer can't find it, we can't make it into a stop!
3. Always sumbit a surrounding photo!
- do not use the same picture as your nomination picture!
- This allows wayfarer to better detect where your location is so we can put your pokestop at the right place!

"Hello good trainers, 

I've been commissioned to write a story on my Pokemon Go Fest experience and time after that. The gamer is conventionally a traveler but games like Pokemon Go have put us in a strange space of being a virtual traveler in the real world and all of this is made more complex when you think about how we couldn't play the game outdoors during the global lockdown. 

Thankfully, due to new features introduced by the game, particularly the remote raid feature, we're able to carry on playing as a new virtual tourist. To write this story I need some help.

I was wondering if anyone here would be able to provide me with screenshots of you raiding across cities, countries and even continents. I'm looking for screenshots of actual raids, the lobby, and where the Pokemon gym display pictures are prominent.

SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
GODDAMN
TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRED

The moronically low pokemon box storage limit has completely and utterly destroyed my enjoyment of this game. With the amount and frequency of new releases and features, 3500 is not even half of what the storage limit should be. I don't understand how stupid Niantic can be. I have spent likely over $1k in this game. But now, I no longer participate in any egg events, because I have no room to collect eggs. I play maybe 1/5 of community days because I can at best eek out a few spaces. I don't raid much because I have to spend 5 min looking for something to transfer before every single raid. I am on the verge of quitting this game due this asinine limit. 

I absolutely REFUSE to transfer things that are either personally meaningful to me, or that may have use in the future. The permutations of potentially useful things has become absurd. We have to consider:

* PvE IVs
* PvP IVs
* Shadows
* PvP Shadows
* Shadow mons that suck but your better ones haven't been TMed yet.
* Old mons for lucky trades
* Lucky mons
* Costume mons
* Shinies
* CD shinies 
* Rare mons (eg. from GO Fest) to save for trades
* Distance trading
* Sentimental mons from personally meaningful locations
* Legendaries
* Legendaries with new/legacy moves

This is all I can think of at the moment but I'm sure it is not an exhaustive list. How the hell is 3500 enough space when you have a dozen or so potential reasons of keep every individual mon???? With 600 in the game, 600 x 12 = 7200. 12 is an arbitrary number but I feel it is an accurate average.

"For the Basic league I've been playing in, it says that the max CP allowed per Pokemon is 500. 

Okay, well the current number of Pokemon I had at close to 500 CP wasn't that many, and I didn't like the ones that I had that were near 500 CP. 

So I thought, okay, well I'll look at some of my other Pokemon who are around 400 or 350 CP, and I'll boost them up to be close to 500 with some candies. 

So I get a couple Pokemon up to like 495/499 CP through using some candies, then go to select those Pokemon to use them in the battle league, and... I can't select them. What?? Why??!! 

It said max CP allowed was 500, my new ones that I just powered up are still below 500, why can't I select them??? Aside from the ones I have powered up, I only have two (my original ones) that are actually in the 490s. They're both at 492, but my third best is at a disappointing 434 CP.

Question one: Is it per species? For example; if I mega evolve one charizard, then later, I want to mega evolve a different charizard, does it have a cheaper price or the full price again?
Question two: What about doing different species? Example: I mega evolve a charizard. Use it until it runs out. Then I mega evolve a houndoom. Use it until it runs out. If I go back to that sake charizard, or another charizard of the species, will it be discounted still for a prior mega, or would it be full price because I mega evolved a houndoom?","""Subsequent Mega Evolutions""",pokemongo
"I think so. Sure, it would cost a ton of energy, but it would help people get legendary Pok√©mon. For example, I want a Suicune in Go. I have one in Home but cannot put it in go. They should make this a feature, but here is what we do to limit the amount of Pok√©mon you can get 
- Only one of each pokemon to trade. This will make sure people don‚Äòt overuse this. 
- Costs more energy to Transfer for Home (for example, if you want to transfer 2 legendary Pok√©mon, it would cost half of your energy
-If it isn‚Äôt in your dex it costs more
Also, remote trading would be fun, I could finally have my dream Pok√©mon. But this is the second best thing. I want it to become a feature, just because it wouldn‚Äôt be too hard.

"Some of us already encountered a rare high level Pokemon with a very low catch rate, those Pokemon that flee after 5 ultra ball excellent throw with golden pinaps üò≥ I mean : Dragonite, Snorlax, Lapras, starters final form and so on...

When they flee... it's RNG, it's life! They are not meant to be easy to catch, of course!! But it's very frustrating when you only see one of those Pokemon every 6 months.

So the idea is :
It would be a cool addition to the game if we could fight high level wild pokemon in order to higher the catch rate when we try to catch the pokemon later. 

(I DON'T want it to be like the main series game where every weak Pokemon flee out of the Pok√©ball if you don't lower their HP, I just want to have the option to fight a 2700CP Snorlax or to throw a ball to a 400CP Pidgey ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

The Pokemon allowed to fight the high level wild Pokemon would be your Buddy Pokemon!
(if your buddy is a weak pokemon, maybe Niantic would allow us to have like 3 or 6 buddies, then you would have the option to use the buddy you want to fight.)

Congratulations, trainer! the wild Dragonite is caught! Thanks to your buddy! (Your buddy won 1 buddy heart). 
Now you have to use a Potion on the Dragonite (of course!) and that's it!
(Yes, Pokestops would provide us more Potions)

Such a feature would also make very rare Pokemon slightly less rare and I find it interesting.

I think it's still a nice concept for a Gym Remake, (I've updated some stuff and some spelling). I know it doesn't looks fancy and, but i don't have the patience nor the skills to do it, xD

Basically the idea is to convert gyms into some kind of HUB with many features that are unlocked by interacting, cooperatively, with the gym. Everyone would be able to add a Pok√©mon regardless of the team, but team with more points would own the gym bonuses. Motivation would take much longer to deplete but when reaches 0 Pok√©mon would leave. Ultimately the gym would reset when the local community would no be able to maintain it.

I only have enough candies to get ONE of them to a usable level, and I'll probably transfer the other 2 (when there's double candy), but I'm not sure which to commit to :(

I played Pokemon Go a lot in the beginning and are now trying to catch up with everything new. I find it difficult to understand the logic in battles for example and would be super happy if someone could clarify it for me.

2. I read that different movesets are better than other. But how should I think when evolving a pokemon? Will it keep the moveset or get a new one? For example, I have a Pichu with Thunder Shock/Thunderbolt which I read is the best moveset for Pichu. But for Pikachu Thundershock/Wild Charge is the best, and Pichu doesn't even have that.

lets start with prices

Standard Pokemon: 10, 1.01kcp = 110, 2.01kcp = 310

shiny Standard Pokemon cost: 2000, 1.01kcp = 2100, 2.01kcp = 2300

&amp;#x200B;

Legendary Pokemon: 1000, 1.01kcp = 1300, 2.01kcp = 1500

Shiny Legendary Pokemon: 10000, 1kcp = 10300, 2.01kcp = 10500

&amp;#x200B;

Mythic Pokemon: 2000, 1.01kcp = 2500, 2.01kcp = 2700

Shiny Mythic Pokemon: 10000, 1.01kcp = 10500, 2.01kcp = 10700

The cap is 10k per 7 days which means if you decide to transfer legendaries you can only transfer 10 max but if you have them over 1.01k that number shrinks to 7. if they are over 2k then its 6.  for mythical pokemon its 5 but over 1k its 4 and over 2k its 3. shiny pokemon unless they are non legendary are at max 5. lengendary and mythic pokemon are capped at 1. 

If this was per 24 hours and melmetal event was capped 1 time per 7 i think people would be ok with that but this is just draconian and overly greedy. shiny pokemon are not as valuable as they once were. especially in sword and shield why do this claim this is for preservation when you lost that element a while ago. when joe merrick says this is not a good thing thats a bad sign.

&amp;#x200B;

I think they should completely rethink the cp pricing. Id say make it 10cp for normal pokemon, 200 for shiny normal pokemon, 500 for normal legendaries, 1000 for shiny legendaries, 750 for mythics and 1500 for shiny mythics. also 1000 coins for immediate transfer is absurd and overly priced this is just gouging us at this point.

"I've been thinking a lot back to Emolga's release as of late.

When Emolga was released, it was the first time in a VERY long time, I actually had to leave the house or, y'know, adventure around to catch something. Its scarce spawns made the game more challenging and made it more exciting as a player who has caught most of the available Pokemon in the game.

Quick flashback to 2017: I was one 'mon short of completing my Kanto dex. The culprit? Hitmonlee. The evening its silhouette appeared in my Nearby, I booked it out of the house in my pyjamas, hopped in my car, and completed my dex. Relief!

Nowadays. . . I just don't get that feeling. Currently new Pokemon will spawn heavily in their first few weeks or appear in 12km eggs. Then they disappear for a bit until the next ""event."" Whoop-de-doo. 

But Emolga? Hot damn. 

It was present in the game for its first couple of weeks, but its spawn was rare. I would see the silhouette pop up in distant places, but never where I was or where I was going. It was elusive. I didn't know what it was from its silhouette (I'm a Gen 1-3 kinda guy) nor could I get to it fast enough.

I can say it's the only Pokemon I can say - in recent memory - that I've gone out of my way - like Hitmonlee - to catch. This was partly also because I knew it was going to ""disappear"" for awhile after the event. 

For future releases, I would love to see tons of Pokemon but made *that* much more difficult to find. Given the lack of biomes, would it be so hard for Niantic to not increase spawns of new Pokemon for a limited time but instead make their spawns rare for a longer time? Isn't that more exciting for everyone?

As a level 40 player from 2016, I feel the game has kind of ""lost its way."" I'm confident a lot of us all feel the same way as I've gone through many complaints here which are very similar to what I'm saying. But Pokemon inherently was a game about adventure and catching. 

Currently, I have no adventure and I have nothing to catch. It should be pretty simple to being both of those back into the game.

"https://imgur.com/WKNoyNo

I'm not big on hatching, anymore, and usually just keep 1 egg in my infinite 'cubater at all times. I always had 10km eggs filling up 8 slots and then 1 slot of just whatever crops up to burn through. Generally, I'll save the bigger eggs for hatch dust events or whatever, since I'm not spending on incubators. 

Well, since these new red eggs came around, I decided it was time for an upgrade: From Purples to Reds!

I made it my goal to prioritize getting mysterious components and battling Rocket Leaders for their eggs. Every time I had a burner egg hatch, I wouldn't spin any stops at all, get up to 6/6 components (if I didn't already have them combined) and find a leader. 

Well, do that enough times in a row and you end up with the reddest -- and *raddest* of egg inventory! 

My only complaint is I have to stop spinning stops! What a counter-intuitive process, and annoying, to boot. Especially annoying when I forget what I'm doing and spin a stop, now that eggs are basically guaranteed when you have a slot open. 

Anyways, it took me a while, but I'm happy I could do it! Now I just need an egg dust event!","Read 'em and weep, boys and girls: All reds!",pokemongo

It's impossible to win against cottonee and bronzor together, even with the best counters, I've tried it already, you can only win with a mirror comp in this case.

Most pok√©mons are useless and we didn't get enough time to save pok√©mon with &gt;501 CP that most people don't have pok√©mon that can be used properly. The fact that the cup is only available for a week makes it a huge waste to use any TMs or stardust for second attacks and leveling up.

Why it can't be just a ""circle"" where all the moves (that doesn't need Elite TMs of course) come one after another, in same order, through all of them, instead of randomly choosing one of them all.

"As the title says, I feel like little cup sucks. Keep in mind, this is just my view and my opinion after all of my sets today. If you think I'm wrong or think I'm the only one that thinks this feel free to let me know; I'd love to hear why, but here's my opinion on it:

1. It's horrible for the casual player. Most casual players don't have the storage space to keep a ton of pokemon, and the first ones to go are almost always the low cp ones that are useless in every other league, so (at least in my opinion) springing this cup on us right before the season starts kinda screws over those players.

2. From my sets today, it feels like if you don't have the exact few meta mons or their exact perfect counters, you're gonna get absolutely demolished. And this goes back to reason 1. Because most casual players probably don't have many (if any) of the perfect meta pokemon for this or many of the perfect counters, it's nearly impossible to win.

3. The meta is tiny. Seems like there's a very small amount of pokemon that are viable, or at least a few that are just blatantly broken. Ex: wynaut/bronzor combo. This combo, unless you have exact perfect counters is absolute busted imo. Even if you have decent counters, it beats you half the time because they're so insanely bulky that it still takes 3 years to take one of them out unless you have literally the exact strongest counters for them

Personally, I've come to the conclusion that with the mons i have at my disposal, this combo is 100% unbeatable unless your opponent just sucks. And AGAIN, it goes back to reason 1...had I known this was coming much further in advance, I could've prepared for it by trying to get some of the counters that are actually effective instead of finding out about it a week before and realizing ""hey I have absolutely nothing that can handle this cup now. I guess this week of GBL is a waste of my time.


4. There's no other option of play. This is the most frustrating of all. Our only option this week is to play the little cup. So for anyone who doesn't have access to the few pokemon that are viable, you're basically fucked for a week and you have nothing else to do but lose game after game after game to the same exact team game after game.

"I honestly care very little about DPS (within reason) in some instances and just want a fast fucking charge move!

But I can‚Äôt find this information anywhere in a usable format. 

Yes, I‚Äôve seen the incredibly detailed spreadsheets on Silph Road but they are honestly just frustrating. If I‚Äôm trying to see what Vulpix moveset gives me my preferred combo of fast as fuck and reasonable damage, I‚Äôm flipping back and forth between two spreadsheets (charged data vs fast move data) trying to remember all the possible moves and find them (spreadsheet organized by DPS instead of type or alphabet) and flipping back to the game and it still somewhat comes down to guesswork. Like this Chikorita absolutely kicked my ass tonight and trying to figure out which charged move it had and how the fuck everything went horribly wrong is making me nuts. 

It‚Äôs just frustrating because there are so many online resources for DPS and ‚Äúbest moveset‚Äù out there, but in this case ‚Äúbest‚Äù is relative. Idgaf if the DPS is 27.5 or 42.1 if my opponent is blocking the move with a shield. Plus with so many battle specific variables that i cant predict or control, I want one I can control. I want to burn through those shields as fast as possible. In trying to figure out how to do this for each new cup or season or league I‚Äôm using loads of stardust, candy, and fast/charged TMs.

"Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started playing Pokemon go again ( i did a little bit when back in 2016), and so far I am liking it, because I live in a very remote area but there are actually spawn and lots of gyms and poke-stops due to the amount of historical landmarks we have here (Northern Portugal). And the game did add some features that seem to be good for my active lifestyle. 

Now, I have to main questions:

* When I using adventure Sync, what kind of activities do count, only walking?
   *  I do trail running every day, about 8 to 10km, I usually don't take my cellphone with me, I do use my Garmin to track, has the music and so on. there. I did configure active sync, but not  my runs, just the walks, do you think its based on activity type? Because I mostly keep under 10km/s since there is a lot of elevation on my routes. Here today'ss run [https://www.strava.com/activities/4311588622](https://www.strava.com/activities/4311588622)
* For the buddy to count kilometers, do you need to take it adventures with you?
   * Its seems likes a good method to get candy for pokemon you don't generally capture, do I need to bring feed it or play so the Pokemon goes adventuring with me, for the kilometers with me.
   * Once or twice per week I do bigger trail runs, around 20km, in those runs I do bring a backpack with me and my cellphone, I plain to open the app, and store the phone upside down, to just let it rack kilometers, would that work?
* Biking does not seem to work at all. I do regular Enduro (2-3 per week) training and not one single kilometer has registered, and the data goes to Google Fit correctly. I only go fast downhill, uphill I am usually below the 10km/h mark.

Any suggestions here ?

It's to the point that I have to leave my Pok√©mon fainted for long periods of time and can't battle a team rocket member or in a raid because all my best Pok√©mon have fainted. I receive so many potions, it's almost obnoxious, but I generally only get revives from 5 star raids which I rarely get the chance to participate in and when I do, there's usually only a few people. It is so frustrating how very hard it is to get revives. With all the updates that lead to more fainted Pok√©mon, you would think Niantic would have made revives a little easier to get. How am I supposed to beat the rocket boss if I have to worry about how many Pok√©mon I'll lose (and consequently can't revive) in trying to do so? I'm not a great player, and thus I must arrive to the most frustrating conclusion of all: Niantic caters to the best players, the ones who reached level 40 within the first two years it was out. For those of us who are average or below average players, even if we play a lot, well, the games' algorithms actually makes it harder for us to play or to complete research tasks (something that seems antithetical to a company that profits off having more active users). I'm not asking that the game be made easier, just that we be given a fair chance by at least having more ways to earn/find revives. And let it last longer than, say, a week. (I noticed once upon a blue moon that revives were more available for a very brief period.) (A few ideas, revives for beating a rocket member, revives for battling trainers, revives with 7 days spin, etc.)

Anyway, am I the only one with this problem?",Anyone else have such a hard time finding revives?,pokemongo

"The new AR mapping quests give Niantic information about the area.

Niantic could have made scanning the stops/gym have a off colored rectangle that after a short quest line with Willow you learn is Kecleon hiding at the stop. This would have gave players a new special research to unlock the ability to find Kecleon, made the reward for their quest scanning much better meaning more people do them, and finally added Kecleon into the game in a new and interesting way that fits it well. If not all devices are able to do the scan then maybe Kecleon is added to the stamp box a few months later so that all players have access to it.

Only the most popular get to be in the game and once Gen 3 was milked of it's best Pok√©mon they just moved on to Gen 4 and then 5 without finishing either. It's all about pumping out more content and if you like Kecleon, well, tough luck.

"Throughout the pokemon game series and and anime ever since  Mega evolution was introduced it was used through Mega keystones and Mega bracelets 

Even after all the updates Mega evolution is sort of a let down.

My idea consists of three things.

1. If you are going to use Mega evolution you need to have a Mega bracelet which is now a permanent item in the item bag.


2.  Yes you will still have to do raids but there is a big difference on how you are going to do make mega evolution, 250 mega energy can craft a keystone for that specific pokemon with the energy. Mega keystones are permanent and won't require any mega energy. 


Pokemon with an X and Y form will require another 250 to craft an X or Y keystone and you can switch between the two.

3. Mega Battle League:1 Mega evolution pokemon allowed and same rules as Master league.


Lastly for pokemon that have mega forms and are fully evolved, will start to gather mega energy instead of candies if they are your buddy.",Mega Evolution idea rework,pokemongo

As an European we can get shiny ferroseed but cmon. We have a very very very small chance to get the shiny from an egg or maybe from the wild.

The most I've ever really participated in past community days is maybe going for a walk and getting enough candy to scrape by with one evolution.

If community days lose the incense bonuses and instead transition back to 3 hour lures I feel like this will be a huge step backwards. I see lots of people saying its good that they're saving pseudos like gible and deino for post lockdown so that you can get them more easily but if we receive those community days without benefits such as 3 hour incense I and I'm sure many others will lose out massively.,Potentially unpopular opinion: I hope that when the world returns to normal community days retain their play at home capabilities,pokemongo

"This is an idea/complaint/bug I think the devs need to fix

Steps to recreate:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Have full Pokemon storage
2. complete a Team rocket battle accessed from a balloon
3. The prompt appears to manage your pokemon storage and make space
4. when you exit the window the balloon encounter disappears and you can't catch the pokemon

I know the answer is to always have space in your storage, but sometimes when you hatch an egg or multiple eggs, the pokemon storage temporarily increases and makes you think you have space, which is what happened to me in this instance, and you only find out that the pokemon you hatched filled your last spot when you've already done the battle and get the window tell you. 

It seems like the devs could make it work as it does for the Pokestops, and that you can tap on the balloon once you have cleared your storage to catch the pokemon, it doesn't make sense that you can do it with Rockets at Pokestops but not for balloons. So I guess the balloons should stay there until you've cleared your storage and caught the Pokemon, rather than the dialog saying ""hey clear your storage, but we won't let you try and catch it"".",Team Rocket Balloon encounter bug,pokemongo

"Personal GBL Historical Recap:

S1:  Totally missed due to Hiatus
S2:  Try hard
S3:  try hard
S4:  Tanked, exept for battle night (dust!)


After looking at the rare candy, dust and more importantly, time involved, I will never try hard again... unless they totally revamp the reward structure.

One of the more enjoyable benefits I've found is you no longer need to pay attention to league optimized IVs; just play with the highest IV mons you have. 

 e.g. My UL Teams had 96-100 IVs but were Rank 1000-3000 for league.  So much dust savings.

Further the Meta no longer holds value.  Pick the same team, learn their matchups and outplay your opponents.  Again dust savings.

So to recap.  you earn more dust, you get a metric ton more candy, you only need to power up the absolute highest IV Pokemons and fewer of them.  In the process you give back way more wins than you normally would over a try hard season all while spending significantly less time.

Seems like a win-win for both you and your opponent. I would","GBL: Once you Tank, you Never GO Rank",pokemongo

Anyways, as it seems 4 years ago I had caught a highly appraised Dratini which I had planned to evolve to what would eventually be a Dragonite. I haven't noticed this or paid attention to it until today; when I had hatched two Dratini eggs in a row only to gain 0 of the supposedly +32 candy I should have gotten. After hatching the first egg I noticed the +16 candy on the top right of my screen and the total count of candy appeared to be a nice even 50. Naturally, I assumed that I had 34 prior to hatching the egg; until I hatched my second and noticed the +16 candy again and the amount of dread and frustration I felt after seeing that I still had 50 candy cannot be described. I am absolutely baffled that there is an actual mechanic in the game that hard caps your candy at such a low value. 


I think I'm about to quit. Did I get something wrong? Am I completely wrong about the candy being hard capped at the value of 50? Did I get a bug? I don't understand. Please explain.",I'm a new player and a mechanic I was not made aware off is about to make me stop playing this game.,pokemongo

The Victini one doesn't have any requirements listed.

I realize some of these were released a couple years ago, but they seem to be more or less the story quests of the game and teach you how to do some things (okay that's a stretch). 

Not sure why I would have the Mew, Meltan, Mega evolution, etc quests if I wasn't around for those. The inconsistency and lack of information is confusing the heck out of me.

"Hello today i have reached level 40 exactly 500 days after beginning my account , i have taken some time to calculate some statistics from these 500 days

On average every day i caught 29.3 Pokemon 

i participated in 523 raids in those 500 days exactly 300 of which where T5 and in those 300 T5 raids i obtained 22 shiny legendaries or mythicals which gives me an approximate shiny rate AT A MINIMUM of 13.6363636363% as i cannot decipher out T5 raids where there was no shiny chance so ultimately the shiny chance is well over 15% which seems oddly high - sidenote 300 T5 raids alone contributes atleast 20% of my total xp without factoring in T1-4 and Mega raids

1317 km total means that i walked on average 2.634km per day and my adventure sync has been broken for the majority of that so that number would be higher - futhermore ive hatched 420 eggs in that time which calculates to 0.84 eggs hatched per day

ive span a total of exactly 8100 pokestops in 500 days which calculates to 16.2 per day

the xp from ultra friends and best friends contributes anywhere from 17.25% to 34.5% to my 20,000,000 total dependent on wether i had a lucky egg on for the interaction or not 

Finally i averaged exactly 40,000xp per day which is fairly decent i think

So, I've started doing raids recently and I guess I got lucky because I managed to get myself a couple Darkrais. That is good, got me really happy. But now I have a couple extra ones and I honestly don't know what I should do with them. Neither their stats nor their moves are that good, and they aren't shinies either, so I don't really have any use for them. 

Now normally I'd get rid of them, but... well, they are Darkrai. So I guess what I'd ask is... what would you do? Would you keep them just in case? Or would you send them to the grinder to get candies for the one that is good? Or maybe I should try to trade it? Even though people don't really play the game where I live and I'm not aware of a trading ring anywhere near here.

I don't really have a deep understanding of the mechanics of the game, and I'de guess I'm in the middle point of being a hardcore player and a more casual one, which means that I don't really do competitive play, but I do like to have the best Pokemon I can.

"I'm guessing somewhere north of 200 candies. I was attacking a gym the other day in an empty park. I got them done to their last bit of CP. Then someone enters the park. All the pokemon are fully healed by the time I'm finished reviving mine.

So I go a round at the gym again. Same thing happens again. We go at this routine five more times. At this point I just wait till he leaves to get the gym.

My question is, around how many candies would that take? 5 of the 6 pokemon in that gym were high level, fully evolved (except one person who put in a magikarp), and to heal them all considering each berry gives lower and lower healing?

"I started playing November 6th 2019. All because I moved somewhere close to Seattle, and landed myself my 12th or so dead end job, and didn't have a car, so I decided to walk and play everyday to and from there, which was about 10km one way. I played in 2016, and like the majority of people who started then, It lost my interest. But I figured since I have the opportunity to walk so much everyday, I might as well play, just to at least have something to get me through the worst part of my day and turn it into something I can enjoy.


I met this girl on a dating/friendship making app called Yubo, she had a boyfriend which I was aware of the moment we had ""matched"" because her profile was mostly made of pictures with them together and she was mostly looking for people to play Pokemon with because her boyfriend wasn't interested genuinely and only played to make her happy. She showed me iv counters and auto catchers and completely changed my perspective of the game and it became so much more then just a way to pass time at and on the way to and from work. It was something I was playing constantly, motivated to be the best there ever was, motivated to steal this man's girl with my impressive collection. 
I was so motivated to show her every Pokemon I got that was even slightly cool. I'll skip alot of unnecessary details but she left her boyfriend for me after finally knowing me about 5-6 months and we would talk and play nearly everyday. 


For about 4 months after all was said and done we played, day and night, constantly reading news, research threads, learning more and more day by day about the game and growing closer because of it. In about May I decided that my goal was to hit level 40 before my account had been active for a year and so the real grind had started. I was about level 30 then and had done the math and knew that it was very possible, it would definitely take the same if not less effort to make it happen by then. 


August came around, and I lost my job, and fell into a depression that I couldn't distract with even the thing that made me happiest, and my relationship fell apart because I let it. Outside of Pokemon we didn't have much of a relationship to go off of. As shitty as it sounds, it was the glue we had bind us. My family offered to have me move out there so I could ""get a fresh start"" and considering everything that happened leading up to this point (which there is alot more but I really don't want to make this post about it and drag it on longer than it needs to be) it was necessary. Both her and I, needed to break up and learn to love ourselves outside of a relationship so we decided to break up and I moved out of state to get my life figured out and deal with life instead of constantly trying to distract myself with weed, women, and woobats. (Just for the record I think pogo is a pretty healthy vice comparatively speaking from my own personal experience)


I get to the state my family is in and everyone is a wreck because of my mom going off the rails, batshit insane, stealing a gun and threatening to use it on herself and others, my step dad's drinking problem only getting worse, my sister flunking out of school and only able to attend about a couple hours 1 day out of the week due to not being able to handle her family falling apart very understandably so, my brother lashing out against the family not being able to process what the others needed and instead focused on how he felt about the situation we had been put in. I did not move out in to an environment where I could focus on problems, I had to be the person everyone needed, I had to talk everyone out of their own emotions and into a place of compassion, honesty and understanding from one another, with what feels like little to no avail. My brother and sister are doing okay getting their lives back in order and are overall becoming better people out of this whole experience, and I know my step dad is as well but our mom has made what seems like practically no effort to change except being prescribed mood stabilizers and anti depression meds and helping out our family ""her way"" which often leads to whatever situation were in becoming worse and us not being able to say that otherwise we are abandoning her and are the bad guys. I could go on but quite frankly I've already told to much to the internet as I like to keep my anonymity in tact. 

6 days ago, I was feeling really down because I was about 1.3 mil XP away from achieving my goal of getting max level before it had been a year and not only did it seem possible but just the very last of my concerns retrospectively, but I decided to say fuck it and play like I haven't before. I joined every raid I was invited to from a max friends list of consistent players, had my incense and catchamon going whenever I was awake and would remember to, used every tool I had to do it and I fucking did it. 


November 6th 2020 I have my account max level, 1 year after starting the account. It's not even impressive with some of the fuckers on this site and their spoofing and xp grind strategies but i am happy because it's something I wanted to do that I consider to be hard and I did what I set out to do, through so much in the way. Looking back at the year I've had, I don't know how possible it would have been without this fun little distraction. I don't really know if this is a happy or sad story, probably different based on whoever's reading it, but I just want anyone dealing with issues out of their control to hear this, persist, life gets better with you making it better, take care of the ones you love and love you unconditionally.

"Waving over from the r/PokemonGO Discord, greetings!

Greetings Trainers worldwide!  

We would like to express our concern regarding the next T5 Raid Boss in rotation, which will be Lugia, and we would like to express our concern in a post related to somewhat of a warning for (upcoming) Raid hosts.  

Lugia is an extremely tanky, low-damage taking Raid Boss, which will definitely be a very challenging Raid Boss for Trainers of lower levels. We don't wish to exclude anyone in their endeavors for the sake of Pok√©mon GO being a game that endorses player co-operation when it comes to difficult Raid Bosses, but we feel obliged to inform the entire server that it's not as simple as ""gathering 5 people and taking down a Raid Boss"", as has previously been the case.   

Lugia is a completely different story and even experienced Trainers (level 35 and above), can (and most likely will) still fail this Raid Boss if not prepared properly.   Take into account that most of the players vary in level, and a group of 4 level 40's can barely carry 2 players that aren't near level 30, given the level 40 group has ""perfect"" counters.  

It is for this exact reason that we want to somewhat help in a way to (at least try to) ensure to keep Lugia Raid failures as minimal as possible, by simply giving you optimal counter Pok√©mon before Lugia descends as Raid Boss.  

**Mega Evolved Pok√©mon: Gengar, Houndoom** \- If you have access to them, use them. They're the absolute best counters against Lugia.  

**Legendary Pok√©mon: Darkrai, Zekrom, Giratina-Origin, Raikou, Zapdos, Terrakion, Mewtwo (Shadow Ball required)** \- These are the next best highest tiered Legendary Pok√©mon to consider throwing into a team.   

**Miscellaneous Pok√©mon: Rhyperior (Rock Wrecker required), Electivire, Weavile, Galarian Darmanitan, Rampardos, Chandelure, Magnezone, Mamoswine** \- If you can't fully create a team with Legendaries, try to fill your remaining team slots with these.  

Please do not be discouraged, but take this time to prepare.  - r/pokemongo Mod Team",Lugia Raid Rotation - Please be wary!,pokemongo

"England is going into lockdown again this Thursday, and France just has, and Wales is already, and Germany is tightening restrictions... so raiding is about to get harder for a lot of us.

Another redditor mentioned, in a comment on a post I cannot remember (sorry), the app GO Raid Party ([Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/go-raid-party/id1525921773) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.tinywhale.remote&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US)). I don't have a raid group so up till now I've (a) just not been able to get legendaries (b) more recently spent 45 minutes dropping in and out of a lobby with a remote pass in the hopes other people will spot me waiting and we can get a group together. So: I figured I'd give the app a shot. And you know what, it actually works, and could be exceedingly useful for those of you stuck inside or unable to meet up with your usual raid group.

Basically it leans on remote raid passes and the invite system to connect you with people at raids or looking for raids. There's two ways of using it:

*Joining a raid*
You open the app, look for the raid boss you want, and join an available party (max 6 people, including the host). The app gives you the host's friend code to copy and paste; you add them in game and tap a button in app to notify them; they accept you, and when the party is all ready, they start the raid and invite you to join with a remote raid pass. They get a button to notify you when they've sent the invite, so you don't need to rely on PoGo's janky and usually-too-late notification to spot the raid. Away you go!

*Hosting a raid*
If you can get out for daily exercise still (as a lot of lockdowns allow) but can't meet up with friends to take a boss down together, the app is mighty handy for summoning allies. You can invite up to 5 people in PoGo, and you pretty reliably get at least 4 of them join (often all 5), which is enough for most T5s. In the app you choose the boss and press Host Party, then as people join the group they'll get your friend code so all you need to do is accept the requests. If someone joins your party but doesn't send the request, you can kick them after a couple of minutes so someone else gets a chance to fill the slot (it uses in-game names throughout so you can tell). Once you have all your new friends, start the raid, sort your friends list by &lt;3 ascending and invite all 5, then tap a button in app to let them know. Takes less than two minutes' effort to set it all up and have a raid party organised for that Darkrai that just hatched. Lovely stuff.

It's honestly so straightforward, and makes raiding legendaries accessible if you can't get out or can't meet up with a group. Remote raid passes aren't cheap, and eventually will do less damage which may make it less viable, but if you can get out and use your free pass to host a party you're doing other people a favour and getting a benefit out of it too. It's well worth a try, especially as we head into The Winter at the End of the World.

Stay safe!","PSA: if you're in/about to go into lockdown, you can organise remote raids with GO Raid Party",pokemongo

I just got my first sinnoh stone. What Pokemon should I use it on? I‚Äôm a fairly new player (lvl 21) if that matters.,Best Sinnoh Stone use?,pokemongo
"First the positives: The costumed Gengar was and the one Galarian Yanmask was pretty sweet. Double candy is always great and I hope they do that forever. I suppose the Aloan Marowak raid was fine since we got lots of free raid passes but I really wish they chose a better raid pokemon like Lampent or Chandelure, even a Cofagrigus since they had that event line with Yamask.

I wanted Mimikyu, what I got was dozens of costumed Pikachu. In the first place, Mimikyu is very lonely and dresses as a Pikachu for more love and attention, Pikachu wearing a Mimikyu costume just seems wrong.

I wanted an army of Litwicks so I can get my first Chandelure, one of the most useful and rare ghost types in the game. What I got was a battalion of non-meta-relevant Sableye wearing Litwick hats. 

Why did I have to do a series of events that forced me to catch hundreds of Driftloon? Why not force me to catch hundreds of Gastly to power up the many Gengar that are appearing in raids?

Not a single event that gives Sinnoh stones to help evolve Dusknoir, Mismagius, and Honchkrow. It wasn't a huge issue for me personally as I saved up a bunch from the Porygon community day but it would have been nice for other players.

I want to emphasize that this was not a terrible event, I had some fun and got some cool stuff out of it. These are just some ways the event could have been better. Maybe if the spawn rates of certain pokemon were adjusted throughout the event. Tons of Gastly for a few days then Yamask then Litwick as rotating categories. I ended up getting maybe 30 Litwick candies versus 600+ Gastly candies, seems a bit unbalanced to me.","Latest Halloween Event - All Trick, No Treat",pokemongo

"Hi.  I haven‚Äôt  played since 2016, a few days ago I reinstalled the game, everything was normal but I noticed that the distance traveled and the progress of the eggs didn‚Äôt increase, I activated the Adventure Sync but it still doesn‚Äôt work. It counts steps and has given me distance rewards but the counters still don‚Äôt increase.  Help.  Any solution?

 P.S. I‚Äôve never used hacks or anything like that.

P.S.2 Sorry about google translate English hahaha",Distances doesn‚Äôt increase,pokemongo
Didn‚Äôt really play much today but figured I‚Äôd do a raid a few minutes ago. Caught this beauty and decided I was done for the day![shiny Darkrai](https://imgur.com/gallery/QOBZ5MS),Nearly perfect shiny Darkrai!,pokemongo
"I'm a returning player and haven't played this game over 8 months. I tried hatching my eggs with adventure sync but it didn't add any progress, I've read adventure sync is bugged so I tried walking with the app open and doing other stuff. Still the no progress has been added and niantic support has not responded to me yet, I hope here someone can help me as it's quite irritating. Before anyone asks obvious questions, yes my eggs are in incubators, yes I have re installed the app, yes I have re booted my device, yes I have refreshed my game data.",egg hatching bug,pokemongo

"I saw that verizon is having its own event this week and I also saw that for the special research you'll need a ""ticket"" or whatever.

"Hola. No juego desde finales del 2016, hace unos d√≠as volv√≠ a instalar el juego, todo iba normal pero me percat√© que la distancia recorrida ni el progreso de los huevos aumenta, activ√© la Adventure Sync y tampoco aumentaba los kil√≥metros, si cuenta pasos y me ha dado recompensa de distancia pero los contadores siguen sin aumentar.

Anyone tried it? I have 3 raids with him and I‚Äôm worried if I continue working in my other buddy I‚Äôll lose my progress with Yamask.,Can I switch out galarian Yamask after each raid as a buddy or does he have to be my buddy the entire time?,pokemongo
I ended up doing 80ish raids for Giratina and 40 for darkrai. When should I start wondering if my shiny has just been shut off??? I can‚Äôt get anything unless it‚Äôs a community day. Is my RNG just awful or am I being punished for some reason?,120+ raids no shiny,pokemongo
Also it‚Äôs very frustrating when you‚Äôre trying to get certain event challenges. I think everyone can agree :),Who else hates the scan pokestops challenges? I think its the biggest waste of time in the game and they should give you more rewards for doing so. I can get more items from pokestops in 15 seconds than the scans,pokemongo
"Just a quick question:

Most months I'm happy with getting a couple of whatever it is but I want to maximize this time--

"i don‚Äôt know about anyone else but i only get pok√©coins from gyms, so i don‚Äôt exactly have hundreds or even of thousands of coins laying around. but i was browsing through the shop today and was thinking about the price of pok√©mon balls; 20 for 100 (5 ea), 100 for 460 (4.6 ea) or 200 for 800 (4 ea). 

i don‚Äôt ever buy pok√©balls so i‚Äôm not here to petition for change or anything but i just feel like pok√©balls should at most cost 2 coins per ball, especially since they‚Äôre just plain/original balls. if they were ultra balls i could understand but not normal balls. following the current deals that would 20 for 40, 100 for 92 and 200 for 160. 

what are your guys‚Äô thoughts?","does anyone else think the price for pok√©balls in the shop is a little steep, or is it just me?",pokemongo
"With the fall semester of school wrapping up we are likely to see an influx of users who have lost access to their email and can no longer play the game.

The recovery process is purposefully difficult (to prevent accounts from getting stolen) and I have never seen a user post about successfully getting it done.

Migrate your account from a school/work/other account if you are not the admin of said email account before you run out of time. 

That is all.

"So i have came back to pokemon go after 2 years since now i had a proper phone rather than an old one and after a battle against team rocket i caught a shadow shiny omanyte (unfortunately it currently doesn't have the greatest stats or moves) but i am curious is getting a shadow shiny as rare as i think or does it occur to many people?

Also side question: is it better to keep a pokemon as a shadow pokemon or purify it?",Is this as lucky as i think or not?,pokemongo
I had my sister make a Pok√©mon go account to do raids with me and out of 14 legendary raids she has gotten 1 shiny moltres and 2 shiny darkrai as well as a 96% darkrai. I have done 53 legendary raids (Ik that isn‚Äôt a lot) without a single shiny or 90+ iv. I hope all of my luck has been saving up for Lugia because that is my favorite legendary Pok√©mon.,Unlucky,pokemongo
